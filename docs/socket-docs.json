This is why rolling out Socket incrementally can be the ideal approach for integrating Socket into your GitHub repositories. In this guide, we will discuss two main methods for implementing Socket incrementally: using projectIgnorePaths and leveraging the silent mode. Using projectIgnorePaths for Incremental Rollout The projectIgnorePaths key in the socket.yml file allows you to exclude certain folders or files from being processed by Socket. This feature works similarly to the .gitignore file patterns. By adding paths to projectIgnorePaths , you can control where Socket runs and where it doesn&#x27;t. To incrementally rollout Socket using projectIgnorePaths , you can start by adding all project subfolders to projectIgnorePaths . This prevents Socket from running on any of them. YAML projectIgnorePaths: - &quot;subfolder1&quot; - &quot;subfolder2&quot; - &quot;subfolder3&quot; Once you&#x27;ve set this up, you can gradually remove subfolders from projectIgnorePaths as you see fit, effectively enabling Socket incrementally. For example, to enable Socket in subfolder1 , you would update projectIgnorePaths as follows: YAML projectIgnorePaths: - &quot;subfolder2&quot; - &quot;subfolder3&quot; This approach gives you the flexibility to introduce Socket into your codebase at your own pace and ensure that each part of your project integrates well with Socket. 🚧 Mind the YAML When using directives like ! and * in your project ignore paths, be sure that you wrap your selector rules in &quot; (double quotes). YAML supports some unquoted strings, however some characters break this feature so its safer to wrap your strings in &quot; . Using triggerPaths for Incremental Rollout The triggerPaths key in socket.yml works similarly to projectIgnorePaths . It uses the same .gitignore style syntax, except instead of matching files to ignore, it matches files to trigger Pull Request alerts on against the set of files modified in a pull request. YAML triggerPaths: - &quot;/subfolder1&quot; In this example, only pull requests that directly modify files inside of the subfolder1 directory would trigger a Pull Request alert report. Any other Pull Requests would not see a Socket check run generated in their check suite. triggerPaths can be used along side projectIgnorePaths . triggerPaths determines when reports are run and projectIgnorePaths determines which package manifest files are included in the report. Leveraging Silent Mode for Incremental Rollout Silent mode allows you to deploy Socket in a non-intrusive way. In silent mode, Socket does not produce any visible indicators like PR alerts, GitHub checks, Dependency Overview Comments, or Security Alerts on your GitHub repository. Instead, all alerts are sent exclusively to a designated Slack channel. To leverage silent mode for an incremental rollout, you would first enable silent mode for your entire repository. This allows you to observe Socket&#x27;s behavior and interactions with your codebase in the Slack channel without any visible changes in your GitHub repository. Once you have a thorough understanding of how Socket interacts with your project and you are confident in its performance, you can disable silent mode. This will enable Socket to start producing visible alerts and comments on your GitHub repository. Remember, to enable silent mode, you need to contact Socket support, as it cannot be enabled directly through the socket.yml file. Conclusion An incremental rollout of Socket provides a measured and controlled integration of the tool into your project. Whether you prefer to use projectIgnorePaths to selectively choose where Socket runs, or silent mode to observe Socket&#x27;s operation in a non-intrusive manner, you have the flexibility to implement Socket in a way that best suits your team&#x27;s needs and comfort levels.

Socket for GitHub does not analyze private npm packages Socket skips dependencies which are private npm packages, since we never read customer source code. This means that we do not analyze the transitive dependencies contained therein. Full support for private npm packages is on our roadmap . Workaround: To analyze private npm package dependencies, you must ensure that Socket for GitHub is enabled on the private package&#x27;s GitHub repository. Then Socket for GitHub will be able access the dependency manifests (e.g. package.json , etc.) for the repository. Alternative Workaround: Add the npm private package as a workspace within your main project. Please Contact support if you need help with either of these workarounds.

All examples in this section are safe to install. Typosquats We recommend installing browserlist which is a typo of the much more popular package browserslist . When installing the typosquatted package, you should see an alert. Telemetry We recommend installing carbon-components which is a package that includes code that pings a server to track when the package is installed. While it may not be inherently malicious, it does pose a potential privacy risk as it collects and sends some system data back to IBM. Socket detects this package Protestware/Troll package We recommend installing [email&#160;protected] which contains unwanted hidden code. This package geolocates users based on their IP address and if the user is Russia-based prints a political protest message in the browser 15 seconds after the package is loaded. The package then tries to redirect the browser to another site using the window.open() function. Recent Malware Examples (Detected By Socket) If you want to see how Socket would perform on real malware npm packages, you can also look through our list of removed npm packages . Furthermore, here are several real examples: ❗️ Warning: The below packages are UNSAFE to install They have already been removed from the package registry, but please exercise caution. Malware executable webb3 – The code is likely malicious and should not be used. filebdecoder – This script is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. It downloads a Perl script from an external source and executes it on the system. This behavior can lead to unauthorized code execution and potential system compromise. node-click – The script downloads an executable from an external server and runs it on the user&#x27;s system. This behavior can be malicious if the downloaded executable contains harmful code. Obfuscated code deahub (PyPI) – This file is encrypted with PyArmor. litter-woker – The script is obfuscated and dynamically creates functions to collect the user&#x27;s environment variables and sends them to a remote server. pyautodllxd – The script is running a PowerShell command with a hidden window and an encoded command. This behavior is considered suspicious and could potentially execute malicious code on the system. The encoded command should be decoded and reviewed to determine the risk. koja_ali_jutt – This code is highly suspicious and should not be used without further investigation. The code is heavily obfuscated and could potentially contain malicious code. The purpose of the code is unclear and further investigation is necessary to determine its exact behavior. mrp-component-icon – This script contains obfuscated code, performs system checks, connects to an external server and directly executes the received response as JavaScript code. This represents a high security risk and possible malware, as the code it executes is dependent on the response from the external server. The server might serve malicious code. The usage of eval() function is also dangerous as it can lead to remote code execution vulnerabilities. Reverse Shell orange_papaya_greed – This script is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. It decodes a base64-encoded command and executes it using bash. This can allow arbitrary code execution on the system, which is a significant security risk. 123rf-ui-core – The script creates a reverse shell, connecting the user&#x27;s system to a remote IP address, and potentially sends data to an external server, posing a significant security risk. namatnawbyteweb1 – This script is highly suspicious and indicates an attempt to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server. This behavior is considered malicious and poses a significant security risk. vue3-babel-js – The code sets up a reverse shell using the &#x27;tls&#x27; and &#x27;child_process&#x27; modules, which can be used to gain unauthorized access to the user&#x27;s system namatnawbyteweb6 – This script is highly malicious and dangerous. It replaces the system shell and establishes a reverse shell connection, allowing unauthorized access to the system. It should be treated as malware and poses a significant security risk. Data Exfiltration airbnb-dls-web – This script is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. It attempts to exfiltrate system information and send it to a Telegram bot. It should be considered a significant security risk. js-integration-demo – This code is malicious and should not be used. Remove it from any system on which it is installed immediately. The remote server should be investigated to determine its legitimacy. segment-bundle – This code is using curl to send the contents of the file &#x27;/etc/passwd&#x27; to a remote server. This is a highly suspicious and potentially malicious behavior as it could cause sensitive data to be sent to an attacker&#x27;s server. dvuln – This script fetches HTML from an external source, potentially allowing for injection of malicious content. It establishes a WebSocket connection to an external server, which could be used for exfiltrating data. The script sends user credentials and cookies to the external server, posing a threat to user privacy and security.

Introduction What is Vanta? Vanta is a platform that automates security monitoring and compliance for businesses, helping them to prepare for audits and maintain certifications such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and more. It simplifies the process of proving your organization&#x27;s security posture to customers and auditors. How Socket Helps with SOC 2 and Other Certifications Socket provides a developer-first security platform that prevents vulnerable and malicious open source dependencies from infiltrating your software supply chain. It assists with: SOC 2 Compliance : By ensuring that all dependencies are secure, Socket supports the security and availability principles required for SOC 2. ISO 27001 : Helps maintain the integrity and confidentiality of information by managing software vulnerabilities. HIPAA : Ensures that software dependencies do not introduce risks to sensitive health information. Why Is an Integration Between the Tools Beneficial? Integrating Socket with Vanta enhances your organization&#x27;s security and compliance efforts by: Automatically synchronizing security alerts from Socket to Vanta, ensuring all potential issues are tracked in one place. Simplifying the audit process by maintaining a consistent and comprehensive view of your security posture. Reducing manual effort in managing compliance tasks, allowing your team to focus on development and other high-priority activities. How to Enable It Integrate from the Settings Page Navigate to the Settings Page : Go to the Socket Dashboard . Set Up the Integration : Find the Vanta integration option under the &quot;Integrations&quot; section. Follow the prompts to authorize the connection between Socket and Vanta. Synchronization : Once the link is set up, all Organization Alerts will be synchronized to your Vanta instance. Alerts will respect your Security Policy , ensuring only relevant issues are reported. How the Integration Works Authorization via OAuth To enable the integration, you will connect your Vanta instance to Socket using OAuth. Upon completion, Socket will store a refresh token in your organization settings for ongoing communication with Vanta. ⚠️ Important Caveat: Vanta often revokes these tokens. Tokens may be invalidated due to: No new scan results within a 24-hour window (including weekends), High alert volume, Other undocumented reasons. If this happens, the integration may appear broken. The recommended fix is to re-authorize the integration via the Socket dashboard. What Gets Synced Alerts: Whenever Socket scans the default branch (triggered via GitHub webhook events, not the GitHub API), it stores all alerts internally and sends the current snapshot to Vanta every 45 minutes. Membership Info: Socket also sends organization membership data and repository metadata from the Socket database (not from GitHub APIs) to keep Vanta aligned. Alerts are sent based on your Security Policy ( Block , Warn , and Monitor ). Alerts marked as Ignore in Socket will not be synced to Vanta. Next Steps Enjoy spending less time manually syncing findings into Vanta! : From now on, Socket and Vanta dashboards will automatically be synchronized and alerts marked as Ignore in Socket will not synchronize over to Vanta. Review Security Policies : Make sure your Security Policy is up-to-date to avoid unnecessary alerts and ensure compliance with the latest standards. Prepare for Audits : Use the integrated system to streamline your audit preparations, ensuring all security measures are documented and up-to-date. By integrating Socket with Vanta, you can enhance your security posture, streamline compliance processes, and maintain a clear and consistent view of your software supply chain&#x27;s security.

If you have a question, join the community and ask! What is Socket? Socket is a new security company that can protect your most critical apps from supply chain attacks. We are taking an entirely new approach to one of the hardest problems in security in a stagnant part of the industry that has historically been obsessed with just reporting on known vulnerabilities. Who built Socket? Socket is built by a team of open source maintainers with over 1 billion monthly downloads. Everyone on the Socket team is an open source maintainer. We are all driven to defend the open source ecosystem from supply chain attacks and make it safe for everyone. What does Socket do? Socket is unique because, unlike other tools, it detects and blocks supply chain attacks before they strike, mitigating the worst consequences: Supply Chain Attack Prevention: Prevent compromised or hijacked packages from infiltrating your supply chain by monitoring all dependency changes in real-time. Package Behavior Analysis: Detect when dependency updates introduce new risky API usage such as network, shell, filesystem, etc. Comprehensive Protection: Block malware, typo-squatting, hidden code, misleading packages, permission creep, and 60+ red flags in open source code. See package issues . How is Socket different from other code scanning tools? The market is flooded with vulnerability scanners (which find CVEs in your dependencies) and static analysis tools (which analyze your app code). Both of these approaches are less than helpful at detecting supply chain attacks of the sort we&#x27;ve seen exploding in the open source ecosystem. Vulnerability scanning tools merely look up the packages you&#x27;re using and compare them to data in the public CVE databases such as NVD . When they find a match, they send you an alert to upgrade to a new version. This is too slow to stop an active supply chain attack. Traditional static analysis tools are way too noisy when run on third-party code, and don&#x27;t provide actionable results. Most developers aren&#x27;t running static analysis tools on their own code, let alone third-party code. Socket is different. Socket was specifically designed to detect supply chain attacks in your dependencies. We built Socket specifically to help catch supply chain attacks such as these that you may have seen in the news: ua-parser-js , coa , rc , colors , faker , event-stream , eslint-scope , and hundreds more. Unlike a traditional vulnerability scanner, Socket can actually detect an active supply chain attack. Unlike a traditional static analysis tool, Socket provides actionable feedback about dependency risk, instead of hundreds of meaningless alerts. How does Socket&#x27;s code analysis work? Socket analyzes the open source dependencies used in your software. Unlike traditional security tools that focus on finding vulnerabilities in your own code, Socket looks at the code of your third-party dependencies. This is important because attackers often target these dependencies as a way to infiltrate your software and access sensitive data or systems. Socket uses static analysis, which is a technique that involves analyzing source code without actually executing it, to identify potential indicators of software supply chain attacks. This includes looking for new install scripts, network requests, environment variable access, telemetry, suspicious strings, obfuscated code, and dozens of other signals, all of which can be signs of malicious activity. We use a custom static analysis engine developed in-house to analyze every package across the entire npm ecosystem (and very soon, PyPI, Go, Maven, etc.). In addition to static analysis, Socket also analyzes maintainer behavior. This means we look at who is maintaining the package and their activity history. This is important because a package with a history of questionable maintenance or a new maintainer with no track record can be a red flag for potential attacks. We also warn about unmaintained packages, trivial packages, and packages which have recently undergone major refactors. Socket also analyzes package metadata to identify signs that a package is risky. For example, a package may load code from a remote git repository or a remote HTTP server, totally bypassing your package lockfile. This allows attackers to load whatever code they want, and even serve different packages to different IP addresses, making it really hard to have a reproducible build or figure out what code is actually going to be run when you install a package. Another use of package metadata is to detect typosquats. We use Levenshtein distance and package download counts to detect packages which impersonate other legitimate packages. For example webb3 is a malicious typo of web3 because the name is similar and the legitimate package has 300,000 times as many downloads as the malicious one. In total, we look for 70+ signals in open source packages, which use different combinations of these 3 techniques – static analysis, package metadata analysis, and maintainer behavior analysis. By identifying attack indicators early, before the PR is merged, Socket helps prevent attacks before they can do any damage. How does Socket&#x27;s capability detection work? Socket uses static analysis (and soon, dynamic analysis) to characterize the behavior of a package and determine what capabilities it uses, which we call “capability detection”. For instance, to determine if an npm package uses the network , Socket looks at whether fetch() , or Node&#x27;s net , dgram , dns , or http or https modules are used within the package or – and this part is key – any of its dependencies. Socket also uses static analysis to detect usage of privileged APIs such as shell, filesystem, eval(), and environment variables. In total, Socket detects 70+ security red flags in open source code, divided over spectrum of issues . What about side channels, such as maintainer behavior? Some of the most valuable security signals come from side channels such as maintainer behavior. Socket detects “unstable ownership” which is when a new maintainer is given publish permission on a package. We also detect when packages are published out of chronological order because attackers often publish new patches on old major versions which still have a lot of usage. Another example of an attack which goes beyond the code in a package is typosquatting , which is one of the most common supply chain attack vectors. We define a typosquat as: Package name is 1-2 characters away from a more popular package The legit package has 1,000x more monthly downloads than the typo package For example, look at how we handle the bowserify package which is a typo. Has Socket caught any notable malicious packages? Yes. Socket has identified and reported multiple instances of malware, leading to their removal from the registry. Our proactive monitoring continues to uncover emerging threats, and we will be sharing more findings soon. We are also working to open up Socket&#x27;s powerful search tools to security researchers interested in hunting for malware on npm. If you&#x27;re a researcher looking to collaborate, please get in touch. For the latest security news, threat research, and insights, check out the Socket Blog. Socket&#x27;s research has been featured in several publications, including Forbes, TechCrunch, SecurityWeekly, The Hacker News, JavaScript Weekly, Risky Business News, and Bleeping Computer . Stay updated with our latest discoveries by subscribing to our blog atom feed or JSON feed . How do I use Socket? Where does it actually run? When you install Socket as a GitHub App , it will automatically evaluate all changes to package.json and other “package manifest” files. Whenever a new dependency is added in a Pull Request, Socket will evaluate it and leave a comment indicating if it is a security risk. We&#x27;re working on a Socket CLI and API that will be released in the coming weeks. What features are coming soon? See what features we&#x27;re working on by visiting the Roadmap . Will Socket support additional ecosystems? Yes.

Efficient alert triaging and robust security policies are crucial for maintaining a secure codebase. In this documentation, we&#x27;ll explore how to manage alerts effectively, ensuring critical issues are addressed promptly while minimizing alert fatigue. For a practical demonstration of these features, watch our demo video on Triaging Alerts &amp; Security Policy Configuration. This video provides step-by-step instructions and showcases real-world scenarios to help you get the most out of Socket&#x27;s alert management capabilities. Accessing Security Policy Navigate to the &#x27; Security Policy &#x27; page from the left-hand menu. On the Security Policy page, you can see various alert types categorized by severity: Block, Warn, Monitor, and Ignore. Example Security Policy Configuration It&#x27;s important to configure your security policy to meet your organization&#x27;s specific requirements. Here&#x27;s an example configuration: Block : Known Malware, Critical CVE Warn : Install Scripts, AI Detected Security Risk Monitor : Network Access, Medium CVE Ignore : Low CVE, Non-existent Author Alert Actions Alert Action Shows up in Dashboard Developers see it (e.g., GitHub comment, CLI prints a warning) Developers blocked (GitHub PR fails, CLI errors) Block ✅ ✅ ✅ Warn ✅ ✅ ❌ Monitor ✅ ❌ ❌ Ignore ❌ ❌ ❌ Legend 🚫 Block : This action will fail the Socket CI/CD check, preventing the merge or deployment process until the issue is resolved. All related alerts will appear in the dashboard, developers will be notified, and further actions will be blocked. ❗ Warn : This action indicates a potential issue that should be reviewed. It will appear in the dashboard and notify developers through comments or warnings, but it will not block the development process. 👁️ Monitor : This action is used for tracking alerts that require monitoring over time. Alerts will be visible in the dashboard, but no notifications will be sent to developers, and it won&#x27;t block any processes. ➖ Ignore : This action is set for low-priority alerts or informational notifications. The alerts will not show up in the dashboard, and there will be no notifications or blocks applied. Triaging Alerts How It Works When a security alert is generated, the initial action is determined by the security policy settings. However, users can override this action for specific alerts to allow for flexible and context-specific responses. This helps reduce alert fatigue while prioritizing the mitigation of critical and high supply chain risks in your codebase. Common Use Cases Dismissing Alerts : Reasons for dismissal include: A fix has already been started. No bandwidth to fix this. Risk is tolerable to the project. Vulnerable code is not actually used. Example: Dismissing an alert after confirming that the vulnerable code path is not exercised in your application. Upgrading Alert Severity : Example: An Install Script alert initially set to Monitor can be elevated to Block after evaluation. Steps to Triage an Alert Identify the Alert : Locate the alert in the Socket dashboard. Select an Action : Choose to Block, Warn, Monitor, or Ignore based on the specific context. Conclusion Effective alert triage and security policy configuration ensure that security issues are addressed promptly and appropriately. By leveraging Socket&#x27;s capabilities, teams can maintain robust security postures while minimizing disruption to development workflows.

Severity Communicates how inherently dangerous an alert is, regardless of where it appears. This is Socket’s global risk signal. All users (Org Admins, Devs, Security) Public knowledge: CVSS, exploitability, malware, Socket threat models ❌ No — set by Socket only Priority Reflects how relevant the threat is in the context of reachability, settings, code usage, environment, and policies. Security teams within the organization Severity + org-specific signals (e.g., reachability, config, triage) ❌ No — organization-scoped Action Communicates what developers should do. A workflow signal from Security to Engineering teams to guide urgency and effort required. Developer teams (via PRs, tickets, dashboards) Security team judgment, playbooks, policies ✅ Yes — assigned by the org or security team Severity : A standardized signal from Socket that reflects the inherent risk of an alert across all organizations. It indicates how likely the alert could be exploited as a real threat. This rating is independent of any specific codebase, reachability, or organizational context. Severity is a global, objective assessment that does not change across environments. Priority : A risk signal customized for each organization. It builds on Severity by including factors like reachability, usage, environment, policies, and triage input. Priority reflects how urgent or relevant the alert is for a specific organization. You can think of this as an organization’s internal version of Severity. Action : A signal from Security teams to Developer teams that guides how much effort should be spent on fixing an alert. This is typically used during code reviews or pull requests. It reflects internal priorities and helps developers understand what needs attention and when. No Overlap: Each label answers a different question. Severity: “How bad is this universally?” Priority: “How bad is this for us?” Action: “What should we do now?” Customizability Boundaries: Severity and Priority are not customizable. Action is useful for customization and policy tuning. Use in Practice: Security teams rely on Priority to triage at scale and automate actions. Developers rely on Action to know what’s expected of them without parsing complex risk context. Socket uses Severity to power risk analytics, threat detection, and dashboards at a consistent level across orgs. Updated 4 days ago Alert Actions Alert Actions and Triage Functionality Ask AI",

This category is reserved for known malware , typosquats , HTTP dependencies , and other critical threats. High Package contains a supply chain risk that makes it unsafe to use in most applications until a manual inspection has been performed to confirm that the package is safe . Medium Package contains a medium-risk supply chain security issue. Critical applications in areas such as finance, health, regulated industries, should manually inspect medium-risk issues. Low Package contains a low-risk supply chain security issue. Quality Severity Description Critical Package has critical quality issues that make it unsuitable for use in all applications. Examples include an invalid package.json which fails to parse, or unresolved requires which import files that do not exist. High Package contains a high-risk quality issue. Medium Package contains a medium-risk quality issue. Low Package contains a low-risk quality issue. Maintenance Severity Description Critical Package has critical maintenance issues that make it unsuitable for use in all applications. High Package contains a high-risk maintenance issue. Medium Package contains a medium-risk maintenance issue. Low Package contains a low-risk maintenance issue. Vulnerability Severity Description Critical Package contains a critical CVE that makes it unsuitable for use in all applications. You should update to a fixed version immediately. High Package contains a high-risk CVE. You should update to a fixed version as soon as reasonably possible. Medium Package contains a medium-risk CVE. Low Package contains a low-risk CVE. License Severity Description Critical Package has a critical license issue that makes it unsuitable for use in most applications. Package should immediately be replaced with a different one to avoid significant legal risk. High Package has a license issue that makes it a risk for use in most commercial applications. Package should be examined by a legal expert, or additional license metadata added to the package to make it safe for use. Medium Package contains a medium-risk license issue. Low Package contains a low-risk license issue. Updated 4 days ago What’s Next Install the GitHub App Socket REST API FAQ Sample Malware Packages Ask AI",

High AI detected security risk AI has determined that this package may contain potential security issues or vulnerabilities. High Install scripts Install scripts are run when the package is installed. The majority of malware in npm is hidden in install scripts. High Non-existent author The package was published by an npm account that no longer exists. High Obfuscated code Obfuscated files are intentionally packed to hide their behavior. This could be a sign of malware High NPM Shrinkwrap Package contains a shrinkwrap file. This may allow the package to bypass normal install procedures. High Telemetry This package contains telemetry which tracks how it is used. High Protestware or potentially unwanted behavior This package is a joke, parody, or includes undocumented or hidden behavior unrelated to its primary function. High Unstable ownership A new collaborator has begun publishing package versions. Package stability and security risk may be elevated. High HTTP dependency Contains a dependency which resolves to a remote HTTP URL which could be used to inject untrusted code and reduce overall package reliability. Medium Potential vulnerability Initial human review suggests the presence of a vulnerability in this package. It is pending further analysis and confirmation. Medium AI detected anomaly AI has identified unusual behaviors that may pose a security risk. Medium Native code Contains native code which could be a vector to obscure malicious code, and generally decrease the likelihood of reproducible or reliable installs. Medium Manifest confusion This package has inconsistent metadata. This could be malicious or caused by an error when publishing the package. Medium Network access This module accesses the network. Medium New author A new npm collaborator published a version of the package for the first time. New collaborators are usually benign additions to a project, but do indicate a change to the security surface area of a package. Medium Shell access This module accesses the system shell. Accessing the system shell increases the risk of executing arbitrary code. Medium Trivial Package Packages less than 10 lines of code are easily copied into your own project and may not warrant the additional supply chain risk of an external dependency. Medium Uses eval Package uses eval() which is a dangerous function. This prevents the code from running in certain environments and increases the risk that the code may contain exploits or malicious behavior. Low Chronological version anomaly Semantic versions published out of chronological order. Low Debug access Uses debug, reflection and dynamic code execution features. Low Dynamic require Dynamic require can indicate the package is performing dangerous or unsafe dynamic code execution. Low Environment variable access Package accesses environment variables, which may be a sign of credential stuffing or data theft. Low Filesystem access Accesses the file system, and could potentially read sensitive data. Low High entropy strings Contains high entropy strings. This could be a sign of encrypted data, leaked secrets or obfuscated code. Updated 4 days ago Vulnerability Quality Ask AI",

While CVEs are crucial for identifying vulnerabilities, they do not always cover malicious packages. Socket enhances security by detecting malicious packages early, sometimes even before a CVE is issued. Severity Alert Type Description Critical Critical CVE Contains a Critical Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE). High High CVE Contains a high severity Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE). Medium Medium CVE Contains a medium severity Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE). Low Low CVE Contains a low severity Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) Types of Scenarios with Malicious Packages 1. Malicious Package Detected, CVE Issued, and Package Removed Description : Socket detects a malicious package, a CVE is issued, and the package is removed from public registries. This is rare since CVEs are typically for vulnerabilities, not malicious code, except in large-scale attacks. Value to Business : Socket shortens remediation time by detecting malicious packages hours or days before a CVE is issued. 2. Malicious Package Detected, No CVE Issued, Package Removed Description : This is the most common scenario. Socket detects a malicious package, no CVE is issued, and the package is removed from public registries. Examples : Most packages listed in our threat feed . Value to Business : Detects malicious packages that SCA (CVE scanner) alone would miss. Uncovers malicious packages mirrored in internal package mirrors (e.g., Artifactory) that continue to be used. 3. Malicious Package Detected, No CVE Issued, Package Not Removed Description : Socket detects a malicious package, no CVE is issued, and the package remains in public registries. Example : event-source-polyfill Value to Business : Identifies malicious packages that would never be discovered using SCA (CVE scanner) alone. Detects malicious packages that remain in public registries and internal mirrors. Additional Package Risk Factors Beyond vulnerabilities and malicious code, Socket detects various package risk factors such as: Unmaintained packages Deprecated packages Obfuscated code Telemetry within packages These detections provide comprehensive insights into the security and quality of dependencies, adding significant value to the business by addressing a broader spectrum of risks.

If you&#x27;re using Conda, you can generate a requirements.txt file from your environment and scan it using any of the Socket scanning methods: API : Upload the file for analysis. CLI : Scan the file directly from your local environment. GitHub Integration : Commit the file to your repository and let Socket for GitHub automatically scan it. This guide walks you through generating a requirements.txt file from a Conda environment that Socket can analyze. Step 1: Activate Your Conda Environment Before exporting dependencies, ensure you have the correct Conda environment activated. If you&#x27;re unsure how to activate an environment, refer to [How to Activate an Environment with Conda]. Run the following command, replacing &lt;env_name&gt; with the name of your environment: Shell conda activate &lt;env_name&gt; Step 2: Generate requirements.txt Once the environment is active, list the installed packages and export them to a requirements.txt file: Shell conda list -e &gt; requirements.txt This will create a requirements.txt file containing all installed packages and their versions. Example requirements.txt Output txt # This file may be used to create an environment using: # $ conda create --name &lt;env&gt; --file &lt;this file&gt; # platform: linux-64 ca-certificates=2020.1.1=0 certifi=2020.4.5.1=py38_0 openssl=1.1.1f=h7b6447c_0 pip=20.0.2=py38_1 setuptools=46.1.3=py38_0 wheel=0.34.2=py38_0 Step 3: Scan requirements.txt with Socket Option 1: Scan via Socket CLI If you have the Socket CLI installed, you can scan the generated requirements.txt file with: Shell socket scan requirements.txt Option 2: Scan via Socket API You can upload requirements.txt to Socket’s API for analysis. Refer to [Socket API Documentation] for details on how to send the file. Option 3: Commit and Let Socket for GitHub Scan It If you use Socket for GitHub, simply commit the requirements.txt file to your repository. Socket will automatically scan it for vulnerabilities and supply chain risks. Additional Notes Conda’s requirements.txt format includes additional metadata (e.g., platform information and package builds). Socket scans focus on package names and versions relevant to security analysis. If your project uses both Conda and PyPI packages, consider using pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt in a Conda environment with pip installed to generate a format that better matches PyPI expectations. For more details on scanning methods, visit the rest of our docs pages (see sidebar). Note Socket scans artifacts published to PyPI, with Anaconda Cloud support planned on Socket’s roadmap. Socket supports the PyPI registry and therefore we can report risks for any Anaconda package which is also published to PyPI. Since Anaconda packages are built from the same source as PyPI packages, most supply chain risks, vulnerabilities, quality, license, and maintenance issues can still be detected—but some supply chain threats may only be identified once Anaconda artifact scanning is supported. Socket supports the PyPI registry and therefore we can report risks for any Anaconda package which is also published to PyPI.

No extra setup is required! CycloneDX If you are unable to enable gradle.lockfile s, then you can use the open source CycloneDX Gradle plugin to generate and commit an SBOM which Socket will scan. You can run socket cdxgen --help for details. To setup a single CycloneDX file that can be checked in you can run: socket cdxgen -t gradle -o socket-gradle.cdx.json --install-deps --lifecycle build Alternatively the CLI has made it easier to generate manifest files using your local Gradle setup. You can use socket manifest gradle --help to get more information on how to run Gradle more directly. This will work for Gradle, Kotlin, and Scala projects that use Gradle (not sbt , see Scala setup instructions for working with Scala&#x27;s sbt files).

If your project uses pom.xml files directly, you can skip generating the manifest file altogether because that&#x27;s what pom.xml is. Generating manifest files with sbt You can run socket manifest scala from your source dir. it will try to invoke sbt to generate pom.xml files for your project. Once generated these can be uploaded by running socket scan create in the same dir. You can specify the input folder, the location of the sbt binary to use, and the output folder through the command flags. See socket manifest scala --help for details on this.

These manifest files are crucial for dependency management and security auditing, allowing Socket to provide comprehensive security insights and alerts. Here’s how Socket detects and recognizes these files: Supported Manifest Files Socket automatically scans for a variety of manifest file types. The primary file types it looks for include: Python (PyPI): requirements.txt requirements/*.txt (when placed in a requirements folder) pipfile pyproject.toml setup.py poetry.lock JavaScript (NPM, Yarn, PNPM): package.json package-lock.json npm-shrinkwrap.json yarn.lock pnpm-lock.yaml pnpm-workspace.yaml Java (Maven): pom.xml Go (GoLang): go.mod go.sum Ruby (Gem): Gemfile.lock *.gemspec Gradle (SPDX or CycloneDX): *spdx.json *cdx.json Malicious Package Alerts If you have included known malicious packages in your project but are not receiving alerts, it may be due to the folder structure or the naming conventions of your manifest files. Ensuring that your manifest files follow the supported patterns should resolve these issues. Additionally, make sure that the malicious packages are correctly installed or referenced within these recognized manifest files. Ensuring Effective Detection To ensure that Socket can properly detect and analyze all relevant files: Follow the recommended file naming conventions. Place custom manifest files within expected directories. Regularly update your manifest files to reflect any changes in dependencies. This will help maximize the effectiveness of Socket’s security features and ensure that your project is fully protected against vulnerabilities and malicious dependencies.

Each type of alert (Critical, High, Medium, or Low) affects the score differently through normalization functions and soft caps. The final score is raised to the power of γ, a scaling factor based on the size and popularity of the project. This exponent compresses low scores and softens the impact of penalties, especially for large or popular packages. Each metric may also optionally apply a limit. Critical Alerts: When any critical alerts are present, this metric is limited to the minimum of 0.25 and a weighted average of other scoring signals. The limit of 0.25 acts as a soft cap because the final score is calculated as 100 × (min(limit, weighted-average))^γ. For example, when γ = 0.8, a cap of 0.25 leads to a final score of about 33%. However, if the weighted average is lower than 0.25, the final score can fall even further. High Alerts: High alerts reduce the score using an exponential decay, e^−x. The metric is capped at max(0.25, 1 − x/10), bottoming out at 0.25 when there are 8 or more alerts. The actual contribution can go lower due to weighted averaging. If this metric becomes the lowest among all, it can pull down the overall score significantly. Medium Alerts: Medium alerts decay more slowly using e^−x/20, with a cap of max(0.5, 1.15 − x/20), which levels off at 0.5 after about 13 alerts. Even though the limit flattens, the normalized value can fall below 0.5 and continue decreasing. Low Alerts: Low alerts have the least impact. They decay gently with e^−x/40 and have no cap, so their effect on the score remains small and gradual. Other Factors: Package scores are also influenced by project attributes like popularity, size, and maintenance activity. These affect the γ exponent. Larger or more widely used packages tend to have a smaller γ, which reduces the impact of negative metrics and allows those packages to maintain relatively higher scores even when some alerts are present. Breakdown: Given a category i , let x i,j be the value of metric j with normalization function N j and weight w j and limit l i,j . Then the score S i is S i = 100 &middot; min ( max (0, min j l i,j ), &sum; j w j N j (x j ) / &sum; j w j ) &#x3B3; Where &#x3B3; is a power scaling constant based on the size and popularity of the project: &#x3B3; &asymp; 1 / 2 + c 0 log(lines of code) + c 1 log(popularity) Currently socket supports the following metrics: Metric Category Weight Normalization Limit Critical Alerts Any 1 e -10x { 1 / 4 if x &gt; 0 1 otherwise } High Alerts Any 2 e -x max { 1 / 4 , 1 - x / 10 } Medium Alerts Any 2 e -x/20 max { 1 / 2 , 1.15 - x / 20 } Low Alerts Any 3 e -x/40 1 License Quality License 12 x / 100 1 Maintainer Count Maintenance 5 -(e x/3 - 1) { 0 if x = 0 1 otherwise } Versions Last Year Maintenance 5 -(e -x/12 - 1) 1 Versions Last Two Months Maintenance 3 -(e -x - 1) 1 Versions Last Month Maintenance 2 -(e -x - 1) 1 Versions Last Week Maintenance 1 -(e -x/0.25 - 1) 1 Open Issues Maintenance 1 e -x/100 1 Closed Issues Maintenance 1 -(e -x/1000 - 1) 1 Commits Last Week Maintenance 1 -(e -x/4 - 1) 1 Commits Last Month Maintenance 1 -(e -x/6 - 1) 1 Commits Last Two Months Maintenance 1 -(e -x/32 - 1) 1 Commits Last Year Maintenance 1 -(e -x/208 - 1) 1 Commits Maintenance 1 -(e -x/300 - 1) 1 Version Count Maintenance 0.5 -(e -x/10 - 1) 1 Readme Length Quality 5 x / 100 1 Bundle Size Quality 2 e -x/16384 1 Stargazers Quality 1 -(e -x/100 - 1) 1 Forks Quality 1 -(e -x - 1) 1 Watchers Quality 1 -(e -x - 1) 1 Lines of Code Quality 0.5 x / 50 1 Download Count Supply Chain Risk 5 -(e -x/10000 - 1) 1 Transitive Dependency Count Supply Chain Risk 1 e -x/1000 1 Total Dependency Count Supply Chain Risk 1 e -x/1000 1 Dependency Count Supply Chain Risk 1 e -x/50 1 Dev Dependency Count Supply Chain Risk 0.5 e -x/100 1 Dependency Vulnerability Count Vulnerability 1 1 - x { 0.5 if x &gt; 0 1 otherwise } Vulnerability Count Vulnerability 1 1 - x / 3 1 Please note that these metrics are subject to change and may be revised as we make changes to our system.

This page is about just one of the reachability techniques that Socket offers. Dependency reachability identifies unused (dead) packages by building a graph of how packages import each other. Although it’s the simplest form of reachability analysis, it has a major advantage: it can help prioritize nearly all types of alerts in Socket, not just vulnerability-related ones like Tier 2 and Tier 1 reachability. How Dependency Reachability Works 1. From Manifest to Map The analysis scans your manifest files ( package.json , go.mod , Gemfile , pom.xml , build.gradle , and others) to generate a complete list of direct and transitive dependencies, along with the dependency graph that connects them. 2. Dependency-Only Scanning — No Access to Your Source Code For each supported language, Socket parses only the files from dependency packages— never your proprietary source code—and extracts every import statement (e.g., import , require , or using ). Language Parser Example we catch JavaScript / TypeScript tree‑sitter‑javascript import { useState } from &#x27;react&#x27; Python tree‑sitter‑python from pathlib import Path Go tree‑sitter‑go import &quot;github.com/user/project&quot; Ruby tree‑sitter‑ruby require &#x27;net/http&#x27; Java tree‑sitter‑java import javax.sql.DataSource; Privacy first: Your source code is never uploaded or stored. The scan runs in a secure worker, extracts only the package names, and immediately discards the file contents. 3. Dead vs. Alive If a transitive package never appears in any import statement, Socket marks it as dead. Then, it walks the dependency graph in the following way: If a parent is marked as dead, its children are also marked as dead— unless they are also required by a live parent. Direct dependencies are always considered alive, since the analysis doesn’t scan application source code to determine how it interacts with its direct dependencies. The result is a clear “used” or “unused” status for every transitive package. What You’ll See in the Product Filter CVEs by Used Dependencies In the Vulnerabilities tab you’ll find the toggle: Used dependencies only . Flip it on and watch the noise disappear—CVE counts drop to only the libraries that actually execute in your application. Enabling the Feature Dependency Reachability is already enabled by default for users on the free tier—no action needed. For paid plans, it’s currently opt-in via the Settings page. We’ve kept it optional during the beta since the additional source-code scan can add a small delay to SBOM generation. After the beta, Reachability will be enabled by default for all plans, with a toggle available if you prefer to turn it off. No additional configuration or build steps required. When you enable Reachability, you&#x27;ll see a significant reduction in noise—on average, 25–35% of transitive dependencies are filtered out as unused. That means fewer alerts, fewer false positives, and a shorter list of vulnerabilities to triage. Updated 4 days ago Reachability Analysis Precomputed Reachability Ask AI",

This page is about just one of the reachability techniques that Socket offers. The Precomputed reachability allows Socket to remove up to 60% of vulnerabilities by looking at how packages in your dependency graph call into other packages in your dependency graph. Full application reachability uses the same underlying reachability analysis engine, but it scans both the application source code and the dependency code. This allows the full application reachability to flag around 80% of vulnerabilities as irrelevant. For some ecosystems, the noise reduction rate is above 90% . The benefits of full application reachability analysis include: Excellent noise reduction – Up to 90% of all vulnerability alerts can be flagged as irrelevant. Powerful triaging support – Provides a precise list of function calls from your application source code that lead to reachable vulnerabilities, making it easier to assess impact and severity. On-premise analysis – While the analysis reads your application’s source code, it runs entirely on-premise (on your machine) and does not share any source code with Socket. Phantom dependency detection – phantom dependencies are automatically detected and considered in the reachability analysis. There are a few caveats to using the full application reachability analysis. It requires a small amount of manual configuration per repository and can be compute-intensive, depending on the programming language(s) and the size of the application. Based on your organization’s security needs, you may choose to enable full application analysis for select repositories, while using precomputed reachability analysis for others. Running the Reachability Analysis Make sure you have the Socket CLI installed. There are also some requirements that depend on the programming language(s) used in the project scanned by the reachability analysis. Language-specific Requirements Python Python 3.11 or newer. PyPy is recommended, as it can speed up the analysis 2-3x uv version 0.5 or newer pyenv version 2.4 or newer is required if the system Python interpreter does not satisfy the version requirement of a project to be analyzed Maven (Java, Scala, Kotlin) Java 8 or newer Nuget (C#) .NET 6 or newer To create a scan with reachability information run: socket scan create --reach If you want to run the reachability analysis but not submit the scan to Socket: socket scan reach The reachability results are then written to a .socket.facts.json file in your current working directory. How Full Application Function-level Reachability Works 1. Invoking the scan The analysis is started using the Socket CLI as described above . You can set up the scan to run at regular intervals in your CI system or be triggered by other events depending on policy. 2. Scanning for CVEs The analysis identifies all manifest files ( package.json , go.mod , Gemfile , pom.xml , build.gradle , and others) in your application. From these files, a complete list of direct and transitive dependencies, along with the dependency graph that connects them, is extracted. Socket scans for CVEs in the dependency graph using a standard vulnerability scan . 3. Computing Vulnerability Reachability For every detected CVE, a static analysis is performed to check the reachability of the affected functions (You can learn more about Socket&#x27;s static reachability analysis here ). This step involves constructing a model of your application called a call graph, which represents which functions call other functions throughout the application. Depending on the size and complexity of your codebase, this process may require significant memory and CPU resources, and can take up to a few minutes to complete for some CVEs. 4. Reachable vs Unreachable CVEs If the affected function(s) are unreachable, the CVE is marked as unreachable. Unreachable CVEs are safe to ignore, as the vulnerable code cannot be invoked at runtime. If the CVE is reachable through one or more paths, the vulnerability is flagged as reachable . For reachable CVEs, Socket shows the list of function calls in your dependencies that may trigger the vulnerability. FAQ How does Socket determine which functions are affected by a CVE? You can learn more about how the Socket team identifies functions affected by vulnerabilities in the FAQ section of the Static Reachability Analysis page. How does Full Application Reachability compare to Precomputed Reachability Precomputed reachability analysis considers only the code within your dependencies, whereas the full application analysis also scans your application’s own source code. While the full application analysis provides better noise reduction and richer context for triaging reachable vulnerabilities, it comes with some trade-offs: it requires manual setup and is generally slower, as the static analysis is compute-intensive.

Socket SCA with Reachability Analysis allows you to safely disregard unreachable vulnerabilities and easily patch the ones that matter. Modern applications are built on mountains of open‑source code. A single package.json or pom.xml can pull in hundreds—sometimes thousands—of transitive packages. Traditional security scanners treat every one of those packages the same, burying you in vulnerability alerts that may never be exploitable in your code base. Reachability Analysis changes that. By understanding which dependencies your application actually uses, Socket filters out CVEs that can’t affect you — allowing you to focus on the ones that can. The Problem: Noise Overload If you’ve ever opened a security dashboard to find hundreds of “critical” issues, you know the feeling: Alert fatigue. When everything looks urgent, nothing feels urgent. Wasted cycles. Triaging false‑positive CVEs steals hours from real work. Slow remediation. Teams struggle to identify the vulnerabilities that really matter to their application. We developed reachability analysis to fundamentally change this dynamic. Key features Based on top-tier research. Scans direct and indirect dependencies. Works with any CI platform. No complex configurations. No agents required. Before Socket: Overwhelming Noise Traditional SCA tools do not distinguish between exploitable and unexploitable vulnerabilities. As a consequence, more than 80% of the vulnerabilities that developers are remediating are irrelevant and can be safely ignored. After Socket: Clean Signal Socket employs Reachability Analysis to eliminate more than 80% false positives. As a consequence, developers only need to remediate the remaining few vulnerabilities that are relevant. Reachability Tiers Socket offers 3 tiers of reachability analysis with increasingly better levels of false positive reduction. The differences are as follows: Tier 3 — Dependency Reachability Tier 2 – Precomputed Reachability Tier 1 – Full Application Reachability False positive reduction (varies between codebases) Eliminate up to 35% false positives. Eliminate up to 80% false positives. Eliminate up to 90% false positives.

A phantom dependency is a dependency that is used in your code but not properly declared in a manifest file. For example, consider a scenario where you specify a dependency on Axios in your package.json . JSON { &quot;dependencies&quot;: { &quot;axios&quot;: &quot;^1.7.2&quot; } } The Axios package internally depends on follow-redirects ( see Axios&#x27; package.json ). Even though follow-redirects is a dependency of Axios and not explicitly declared in your package.json, it is still possible to load it in your code. For example: JavaScript const followRedirects = require(&#x27;follow-redirects&#x27;); console.log(followRedirects); This behavior is possible because the npm package manager installs follow-redirects into the node_modules folder when Axios is installed. The require function does not check your package.json; it simply loads any module present in node_modules , regardless of whether it’s explicitly declared. Using phantom dependencies is generally considered an anti-pattern, as it can lead to bugs and unpredictable behavior. For example, if Axios is updated to a version that no longer depends on follow-redirects, your code will break if it relied on follow-redirects being available. This issue isn’t unique to JavaScript—most programming languages and package managers suffer from design quirks that allow phantom dependencies to be used in code. Phantom Dependencies and Reachability Analysis Since phantom dependencies are relatively common, reachability analyses should be designed to scan for vulnerable functions in them. Socket&#x27;s reachability analysis does exactly that—it scans all dependencies, regardless of how they are declared. If a reachable vulnerability is found in a phantom dependency, the UI clearly labels it as such. Vulnerabilities in phantom dependencies are no more or less severe than those in explicitly declared dependencies—they pose the same risk if reachable from your application.

This page is about just one of the reachability techniques that Socket offers. Dependency reachability filters out vulnerabilities in modules that are not loaded, typically resulting in about a 35% reduction in alerts. However, the fact that a module is loaded doesn’t guarantee that all of its functions or methods are actually used. Precomputed reachability builds on this by answering the question, “What functions are actually called in your dependencies?” Since most functions in a typical application are unused, Precomputed reachability enables Socket to flag around 60% of vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies as irrelevant . The benefits of precomputed reachability include: Good noise reduction – It offers better noise reduction than dependency reachability by analyzing usage at the function level. High performance – Results for most dependency chains are precomputed and cached by Socket, making the analysis extremely fast. Manifest-based – It works solely from your manifest files (e.g., package.json , go.mod , etc.). No source code access required – It does not require access to your application’s source code. Zero setup – It’s available immediately to all Socket users with no additional configuration. Example of an Unreachable Vulnerability Let’s walk through a typical example. The vulnerability CVE-2024-37890 affects the npm package ws , which is used to create WebSocket clients and servers. It’s a serious issue—an attacker can crash a ws server just by sending a request with many headers. If you’re using the WebSocketServer from ws directly, you should patch this vulnerability as soon as possible. But many developers don’t depend on ws directly. Instead, they inherit it as an indirect/transitive dependency through other packages in the npm ecosystem. Even if you never import ws yourself, you’ll still get an alert about this CVE if some package in your dependency tree pulls it in. These indirect usages might still be vulnerable—but in many cases, reachability analysis can prove they’re not. Consider the package jsdom , which depends on ws (See jsdom&#x27;s package.json ). Its usage of ws is not vulnerable since it only uses the client-side functionality of ws . Specifically, it calls WebSocket at this location , without ever touching WebSocketServer . So if ws is used in your project through jsdom , CVE-2024-37890 isn’t something you need to worry about. A static reachability analysis can check that jsdom doesn’t use the vulnerable part of ws , and this information can be stored in a database. So, when an SCA tool detects CVE-2024-37890 in your SBOM or dependency tree, it can safely mark it as unreachable—if jsdom is the only package that depends on ws . If more packages depends on ws , then reachability information must be computed for these packages as well. How Precomputed Reachability Works 1. From Manifest to Dependency Graph The analysis begins similarly to dependency reachability, starting with your manifest files ( package.json , go.mod , Gemfile , pom.xml , build.gradle , and others). From these files, a complete list of direct and transitive dependencies — along with the dependency graph that connects them — is extracted. 2. Scanning for CVEs Socket scans for CVEs in the dependency graph using a standard vulnerability scan . 3. Computing Vulnerability Reachability For every detected CVE, Socket identifies all the paths in the dependency graph that lead to the affected package. For each of these paths, a static analysis is performed to check the reachability of the affected function (You can learn more about Socket&#x27;s static reachability analysis here ). If reachability has already been computed for a specific path, the result is reused. 4. Reachable vs Unreachable CVEs If the affected function(s) are unreachable through all paths in the dependency graph, the CVE is marked as unreachable. Unreachable CVEs are safe to ignore, as the vulnerable code cannot be invoked at runtime. If the CVE is reachable through one or more paths, the vulnerability is flagged as maybe reachable . For maybe reachable CVEs, Socket shows the list of function calls in your dependencies that may trigger the vulnerability. The term maybe reachable is used instead of definitely reachable because, even if a vulnerable function is reachable from a direct dependency, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the relevant parts of that dependency are used by your application’s own source code. Limitations Phantom Dependencies Precomputed reachability operates under the assumption that your application only loads its declared direct dependencies. This means that if your code loads a phantom dependency —a package not listed in your manifest file—vulnerabilities in that package may be incorrectly classified as unreachable. We consider this limitation minor, as phantom dependencies are both a poor practice and relatively uncommon in most projects. However, if you’re concerned about vulnerability reachability in phantom dependencies, we recommend using the Full Application Reachability mode . This mode can both detect phantom dependencies and accurately assess the reachability of vulnerabilities within them. Direct Dependency Vulnerabilities The precomputed reachability analysis only works on vulnerabilities in transitive/indirect dependencies. This means the analysis works best when most vulnerabilities are in the transitive dependencies. You need to use the Full Application Reachability analysis on applications with a low fraction of transitive dependencies. FAQ How does Socket determine which functions are affected by a CVE? You can learn more about how the Socket team identifies functions affected by vulnerabilities in the FAQ section of the Static Reachability Analysis page. How does Precomputed Reachability compare to Full Application Reachability Precomputed reachability analysis considers only the code within your dependencies, whereas full application reachability also scans your application’s own source code. While full application analysis provides better noise reduction and richer context for triaging reachable vulnerabilities, it comes with some trade-offs: it requires manual setup and is generally slower, as the static analysis is compute-intensive.

The CVE Reachability filter demonstrates this categorization: Socket&#x27;s CVE Reachability filter Concluded Reachable (tier 1 only) There is at least one chain of function calls from the application code through the dependencies that may trigger the CVE. This categorization is only possible when using tier 1 full application analysis. API type: &#x27;reachable&#x27; Potentially reachable (tier 2 only) There is at least one chain of calls from either a direct dependency or a dependency at least 3 steps upstream from the vulnerable package in the dependency tree, that may trigger the CVE. This categorization is only possible when using the tier 2 precomputed analysis. If you run a tier 1 full application analysis on projects with potentially reachable CVEs, these CVEs would either go to the &#x27;reachable&#x27; or the &#x27;unreachable&#x27; category, depending on how the application code interacts with its dependencies. API type: &#x27;maybe_reachable&#x27; Unreachable There is no chain of calls that trigger the CVEs. Unreachable CVEs are unexploitable and therefore safe to ignore. API type: &#x27;unreachable&#x27; Awaiting Conclusion Pending precomputation (tier 2 only) Socket does not have the reachability results precomputed for the particular chain of dependencies leading to the package with the CVE. Socket will queue the chains for analysis and then process them later. Under normal load scenarios, the chains will be processed within a few minutes. Socket scans are currently immutable, so you will have to conduct a new scan for the CVEs to move out of the pending category. API type: &#x27;pending&#x27; Not yet supported Socket&#x27;s reachability team has not yet classified the functions in the vulnerable package responsible for the CVE. You can learn more about the process of curating CVEs with reachability information here . API type: &#x27;missing_support&#x27; Inconclusive Direct Dependency (tier 2 only) The CVE is in a direct dependency, which makes it impossible to use the precomputed tier 2 analysis. This categorization should be seen as a special case of unknown reachability, only possible when using tier 2 analysis. API type: &#x27;direct_dependency&#x27; Not determinable Socket&#x27;s reachability team has analyzed the CVE and determined that reachability analysis is not possible. Most non-determinable CVEs affect CLIs or binaries that are not meant to be used from code. API type: &#x27;undeterminable_reachability&#x27; Unknown CVEs can be classified as unknown for various reasons. Typically, it&#x27;s because of issues encountered during a tier 1 analysis. A common example is when running a tier 1 analysis on a project that uses private dependencies where dependencies are not preinstalled. In this scenario, it&#x27;s not possible for Socket to auto-install the missing dependencies, and any CVEs in private dependencies or dependencies of private dependencies will be classified as unknown. You should consult your tier 1 analysis logs for more information if you have unknown CVEs. API type: &#x27;unknown&#x27; Error An error prevented the reachability analysis from classifying the CVE. In the case of a tier 1 analysis, you can consult the logs for more information. For tier 2, reach out to Socket&#x27;s support.

An important advantage of Socket&#x27;s SCA over other traditional vulnerability scanners is its reachability analysis that determines which vulnerabilities are actually reachable from the entry points of your project. This is important because in most projects, the majority of vulnerabilities (typically more than 80%) are not reachable and thus not exploitable. The Tier 1 and Tier 2 reachability analyses are powered by advanced static analysis techniques that, depending on the analysis tier , scan both your application’s source code and its dependencies. This enables the analysis to build a detailed model of how dependencies are used within your application. Built on decades of cutting-edge research in static analysis, the tool is designed to handle complex language features effectively - including reflection in Java and dynamic reads and writes in JavaScript. Socket’s reachability analysis can identify vulnerabilities not just in direct dependencies, but also in indirect (transitive) ones - including dependencies of dependencies, and so on, to any level of depth. (Read more about Socket&#x27;s approach to reachability analysis in this blog post ). The advantages of the static reachability analysis used by Socket are: Unlike other vendors, you don&#x27;t have to install disruptive runtime agents in your production environment to conduct reachability analysis. In Tier 2 and Tier 3 modes, the reachability analysis is available to all existing Socket users on the team and enterprise plans without any additional setup. In Tier 1 mode, it runs via the Socket CLI that automatically gathers all the information needed to perform the analysis on your project, making it extremely easy to adopt. It uses tailored static analysis for each programming language, making it exceptionally accurate and capable of reasoning about the reachability of vulnerabilities deep down in dependency graphs. There are some limitations and caveats to the reachability analysis: We are committed to building highly accurate reachability analyses. However, no analysis is ever perfect, and in very rare cases, vulnerabilities may be incorrectly reported as unreachable. To minimize these inaccuracies, we design language-specific static analyses capable of handling complex language features — such as reflection in Java and dynamic reads and writes in JavaScript — effectively. Additionally, our reachability analysis is intentionally conservative: a vulnerability will only be marked as unreachable if there is strong confidence that it truly cannot be exploited. Reachability analysis is computationally more expensive than traditional vulnerability scanning, which may result in long-running scans for certain types of projects. This is only relevant for tier 1 full application reachability . JVM and .NET Socket’s static reachability analysis for JVM and .NET used in the tier 1 and tier 2 modes, does not operate at the function level. Instead, it constructs a cross-dependency module load graph. This approach is chosen because it works effectively across both source code and bytecode. That flexibility is especially valuable in full application reachability mode, where it allows Socket to perform reachability analysis without requiring the application to be built, making both the analysis faster and the setup process significantly easier. While this method isn’t true function-level analysis, it still achieves noise reduction rates comparable to function-level reachability in other ecosystems. FAQ How does Socket know which parts of a package are affected by a vulnerability? Our dedicated reachability team focuses specifically on answering that question. Here’s how the process works: Vulnerability disclosure: When a new vulnerability is reported, the reachability team at Socket is alerted. In-depth investigation: A team member conducts a detailed analysis to understand how the vulnerability impacts the package. This includes: Reviewing the vulnerability advisory description. Studying the documentation of the affected package. Installing and inspecting the package’s code. Using internal AI tools to extract as many insights as possible. Reachability specification: The team creates a specification that clearly outlines which parts of the package, usually specific functions, are affected. Peer review: Another team member reviews the specification before it’s published. What happens if Socket&#x27;s analysis doesn&#x27;t yet have a specification for a vulnerability? In that case the vulnerability is still included in the report, but it is marked with an unknown reachability status. We strive to add support for all new vulnerabilities within 24 hours of their public disclosure. What if a vulnerability cannot be tied to a specific part of a package? We use a fallback mechanism to handle cases where a vulnerability cannot be tied to a specific part of a package. This often includes vulnerabilities in packages used as Command Line Interface (CLI) tools rather than libraries. For these cases, we classify the reachability of the vulnerability as unknown and provide guidance on what you should manually check to determine whether your application is affected. Many of these vulnerabilities are safe to ignore in most scenarios — for example, if the vulnerability is in a package typically used only during the application’s build phase, such as CVE-2023-45133 . If your manual assessment concludes that a vulnerability is irrelevant to your context, we recommend using alert triage to ignore it.

This extension helps you identify and mitigate risks from open-source packages before they impact your projects. To function effectively, the extension requires specific permissions, which you can configure through your Chrome browser settings. Key Features of the Socket Chrome Extension Instant Security Metrics : Provides security insights directly on NPM, PyPI, Go, and Maven package pages and search results. Real-Time Risk Detection : Identifies potential threats such as malware, typo-squatting, and vulnerable dependencies. Customizable Site Access : You can control the sites where the extension is active. Total Threats Display: Instantly view the total number of threats detected. Low, Medium, High, and Critical Threat Alerts: Differentiate between varying severity levels to prioritize your security efforts. For more detailed insights, visit the Socket Blog on the Web Extension . Privacy Considerations The Socket Chrome Extension is designed with your privacy in mind. The extension only communicates package names if any are found on the page you are visiting. If no package is detected, there is absolutely no request to Socket&#x27;s servers being made. This ensures that your browsing activities remain private and secure. Configuring Site Access for the Socket Chrome Extension The Socket Chrome Extension requires several permissions to function optimally. Below is a breakdown of these permissions: Extension Overview: The Socket Security extension is designed to help you secure your supply chain. Version: 1.0.0 Size: &lt; 1 MB Permissions: The extension requires permission to read and modify data on websites you visit. Configuring Site Access: Site Access Options: On all sites: Grants the extension access to all websites you visit. On specific sites: Limits the extension&#x27;s activity to specified sites. On click: Activates the extension only when you click on it. Adding a Specific Site: Choose &quot;On specific sites&quot; to limit the extension’s access. Click on &quot;Add a site.&quot; Enter the site’s URL where you want the extension to be active (e.g., https://www.npmjs.com/ ). Confirm by clicking the &quot;Add&quot; button. Additional Settings: Allow in Incognito: Enable the extension in incognito mode, although it may not record browsing history. Allow access to file URLs: This allows the extension to access files on your computer if necessary.

You can install it from the Chrome Web Store just like you would in Chrome. Firefox is also supported directly. Why Use Socket Security? At Socket, we want to make the web a safer place for developers. Our completely revamped web extension helps you detect these threats in real-time and identify safe packages directly from your browser. It offers instant security metrics, identifying potential threats such as malware, typosquatting, and vulnerable dependencies. We have also expanded support beyond npm to include PyPI, Go, and Maven package and search results. Example of an NPM Package with Socket Analysis In this image, we see a package analysis page for the &quot;browser&quot; package version 0.2.6. The extension provides detailed security metrics including Supply Chain Security, Quality, Maintenance, Vulnerabilities, and License scores. It highlights specific issues such as floating dependencies, shell access, and critical dependency issues (e.g., CVEs). The package scores indicate overall risk and potential concerns that users need to address. This detailed insight helps developers make informed decisions about the security and reliability of their dependencies. Value to Your Business Early Detection : Socket can shorten the remediation time by detecting malicious packages hours or days before there is a CVE. Comprehensive Coverage : Socket uncovers malicious packages that would never be uncovered using SCA (CVE scanner) alone. Continuous Protection : Socket detects and blocks supply chain attacks before they strike, mitigating the worst consequences. Install the Socket GitHub App Currently, the extension does not support manual scanning of webpages or viewing reports on potential vulnerabilities directly from the extension interface. The primary functionality is to provide real-time security metrics and alerts while browsing package pages. For more detailed analysis and reports, you would need to use the full Socket Security platform. Want to defend your entire organization against open-source attacks?

How do I start using &quot;safe npm&quot;? Install the Socket CLI by running npm install -g socket – that&#x27;s it! That command will add a socket binary to your PATH. Then, you can use socket npm install instead of npm install to benefit from Socket’s protections. How can I use this without replacing all my code that uses npm? socket npm will automatically detect if it is in front of npm in the PATH variable, and if it is not it will prepend itself to the PATH to intercept commands. This means if you use something like socket npm run script-with-npx it will already intercept npx without you needing to change your package.json . You can use socket wrapper --enable to create an alias such that this happens implicitly when running npm or npx . If you&#x27;d rather do this yourself you can create a shell alias like the following in your .bashrc or .zsh : Shell alias npm=&quot;socket-npm&quot; alias npx=&quot;socket-npx&quot; For zsh autocompletions you may wish to add the following as well: Shell compdef \\_npm socket-npm For bash autocompletions you may wish to add the following as well: Shell $(complete -p npm | sed &#x27;s/npm$/socket-npm/&#x27;) Why do I see an alert when using socket npm uninstall foo ? You might think that removing a package could never cause a new package to be installed, but you&#x27;d be mistaken! It&#x27;s possible for npm uninstall or npm rm to actually install new packages. So, as counterintuitive as it might seem, you also need to be careful when running npm uninstall . Fortunately, Socket protects you in that situation if you use socket npm uninstall – so not to worry! Wait, why would npm uninstall ever install new packages? npm creates what is called the &quot;ideal tree&quot; for a given package.json . So by removing a package you might actually change what the ideal tree is. Removing a package may remove a constraint which is keeping a package on an older version, so then npm may update those packages to a more ideal/recent version. For example, if foo depends on [ [email&#160;protected] ](mailto: [email&#160;protected] ) it will constrain bar to be on 1.1.x but a different dependency baz might depend on [ [email&#160;protected] ](mailto: [email&#160;protected] ) which constrains bar to any version 1.x.x . If [ [email&#160;protected] ](mailto: [email&#160;protected] ) exists it would be available to use if foo is removed from the package.json ! This &quot;ideal tree” step also performs automatic updates when using npm install in its default configuration. If a package bar exists in your package.json it will automatically be updated upon being found even if what you’re installing is unrelated to bar in any way. Why am I seeing alerts for an unrelated package when using socket npm install foo? Same reason as above. When will you support yarn and pnpm? Socket supports yarn and pnpm throughout the product. See our full list of supported language ecosystems and package managers for more information. However, for this current release of &quot;safe npm&quot;, we only support npm . When will you support pip, poetry, etc.? Socket supports Python. Specifically, Socket for GitHub already supports pip , poetry , and other popular Python package managers. You can read the announcement where we introduced Python support. If you would like to see support for &quot;safe pip&quot; functionality, similar to &quot;safe npm&quot;, please vote for this feature request here. With enough demand, we&#x27;d love to bring this feature to more ecosystems! How is the wrapper implemented? There were lots of interesting things we had to do in order to completely cover various situations in npm and avoid some escapes that would bypass our wrapper. When you alias the wrapper with alias npm=&quot;socket npm&quot; it would have been buggy if we didn&#x27;t guard against basic child process invocation. For example running npm run will invoke a child process that can remove that alias. To that end, we are doing some tricks to protect against this. More information can be found in our documentation .

The CLI itself runs locally, but certain commands need to communicate with our public API, for example by uploading your dependency manifest files to Socket for analysis or asking about the repositories you&#x27;ve defined. Socket is designed to work without the need to analyze, upload, or share your source code. The only data we collect from your repository are manifest and associated lock files. For example, for npm we&#x27;d collect package.json / package-lock.json , for python requirements.txt / requirements.lock.txt , or Ruby Gemfile / Gemfile.lock . This is what we call the dependency snapshot. We do this for every ecosystems we support. We use the dependency snapshot to determine the list of packages used by your repository, perform our open source risk analysis, and produce a report. Can I look at reports locally on the computer? Yes! If you have a Scan ID you can use socket scan view or socket scan report to view details on them. You can export them raw with the --json flag or get nice shareable output with the --markdown flag. Why does my scan not show up in the alerts dashboard? Most likely you need to set the --pending-head flag. Without that option new scans will not show up. It should still show up in the &quot;Full Scans&quot; page, regardless. Why is there a Scan URL without results? When using socket report create the files are uploaded and a Scan ID is created and returned to you right away. The actual report is generated lazily when you go to view it. When you specify the --report flag, the CLI does this fetch for you and will trigger the generation, then reads the results to report the outcome to you.

Main features Control Socket from your terminal and your code! Create Socket Security Scans from your terminal with socket scan create Get information on the security score of a package through socket package score Check if your PR passes your security/license policy by socket scan --report OR take control and automate your workflow through socket ci Protect your workspace with socket wrapper on or run npm through socket npm View security health history dashboards in your terminal with socket analytics Easy access to our real time threat feed through socket threat-feed Apply security updates to packages through socket fix Apply enhanced package overrides with socket optimize Control account details on Socket Most commands support --json and --markdown for automation Interactive terminal experience for setup and dashboards See sidebar for overview of commands. Or run socket --help to see the available commands. What&#x27;s in a Scan report? A Socket Scan contains a full listing of all package issues present in the project, as well as individual health scores for each package and average scores for the whole project. There&#x27;s a lot of incredible information about your packages in here: How does the CLI work? socket is a multi-command CLI tool. The basic socket command does nothing more than giving you some help information, the rest of the magic is in the individual commands. All commands describe themselves if you ask them using --help . There are a few categories of commands: Commands leveraging the Socket API These commands give you easy access to our Socket API. This gives you access to organization information, repository management, scan management, analytics, audit logs, and thread feed. Most of these commands require an API Token for access with the proper scope depending on the task. Commands will inform you when this is the case. You can generate API Tokens from your Socket dashboard. Commands running local tools There are some things we can&#x27;t do on the server. We don&#x27;t have access to your full source code and in some purposes or ecosystems we would need that in order to complete our analysis. We also have a few tools that work on your source code. Local tools are kind of what it sounds like: commands that are expected to run locally. They may generate an artifact that you can upload or commit. But it&#x27;s something we can&#x27;t ordinarily do on our servers. As such these commands do not require an API Token. Concretely, this includes generating manifest files for certain ecosystems (gradle, sbt), fixing or optimizing your package.json , or computing tier 1 reachability. Commands for CLI configuration There are also a few commands created for management of the CLI itself or its environment. You can configure all its persisted settings. You can install the tab-completion script in case you didn&#x27;t do this when logging int. You can login, which sets up a few things for you. You can logout or uninstall the tab completion script. You can toggle the wrapper. Flags Every individual (sub-)command supports a few command flags. To find out what flags are supported by a (sub-)command and what they do, see the individual --help page of that command. Output The CLI was designed to be able to be used with other tools in mind. You should be able to &quot;pipe&quot; ( send ) the result ( of stdout ) of the CLI to another command to work on that result. Most commands that don&#x27;t require interactivity or calling another tool will support a --json and --markdown flag. When they do, we try really hard to always return a proper response, even if things fall apart. --json – outputs result as json which you can then pipe into jq and other tools --markdown – outputs result as markdown which you can then copy into an issue, PR or even chat Generic flags These flags are supported by every (sub-) command but they are not mentioned in their individual help page. --config – Overrides the internal config object with the result of this JSON for the duration of this call. Mostly helpful for debugging and tests. Persisting config changes will be disabled when this is used. --dry-run – validate inputs without starting on the actual task. This starts a command and will stop after the input validation. --help – prints the help for the current command. All (sub-) commands have their own help page. --version – prints the version of the tool. The version information is also printed as part of the banner at the top of every command. How can I get my hands on this? Install it like this: npm install -g socket Then run it using commands like: socket --help socket package score npm [email&#160;protected] --markdown socket scan create ./proj socket login If you don&#x27;t like to be asked for an API token all of the time you can do socket login to store the token locally. This command also helps you to set up the CLI with interactive questions. Alternatively you can supply an API Token when running a command by setting it as an environmental variable: SOCKET_SECURITY_API_TOKEN=xyz socket scan list If you want to add the environment variable for a local project but not globally, then use a tool like direnv . Is the CLI distributed without using the npm registry? Not as a fully built artifact. The ability to install software from the npm registry is a normal and generally accepted practice at the time of writing. The code is open source, though. You can find the repository in its GitHub repository and you can build it manually. Updated 4 days ago What’s Next socket info CLI source code on GitHub Ask AI",

If you were using the Socket CLI before v1.0.0 you may need to go through this guide to see if something changed. If you use the CLI locally you may want to socket login again to set the default org, or otherwise it will ask you to confirm the org when you run commands that need it. In CI you can use --org xyz instead. commands In general: We tried to streamline usage of the CLI (: the mandatory org name (slug) argument has been dropped from all commands that had it in favor of a stored default org. When this config value is not set but required by a command (which many commands do) an interactive prompt will try to resolve it for you. If you want to specify the org explicitly anyways (like probably in CI) you can use --org &lt;orgname&gt; instead. It should work for all commands that might use an org and will show up in --help . the mandatory cwd arg or flag has been dropped from many commands in favor of an optional argument, using the current directory as the default. A few commands will still use a --cwd flag if that just makes more sense. Any shortcuts for flags were removed (they were not advertised) socket analytics The command flags were changed to args. Before: socket analytics --scope org --time Y socket analytics --scope repo --repo X --time Y after: socket analytics org Y socket analytics repo X Y The args are optional but the order is fixed. When you use &quot;repo&quot; the repo name is mandatory. The repo/scope/time flags are no longer supported. socket audit-log The command now defaults to the default org setting. It will prompt you if none is set. You can use --no-interactive to prevent this prompt which will cause the command to fail. You can override that and explicitly set the org through the --org flag instead. The type filter has now become the first argument, still optional. Before: socket audit-log --page 10 --perPage 50 socket audit-log --type createLabel --page 10 --perPage 50 after: socket audit-log --page 10 --perPage 50 socket audit-log createLabel --page 10 --perPage 50 socket dependencies This command moved to a sub-command of orgs: socket organization dependencies (but you can use the secret alias socket deps or keep using the secret alias socket dependencies too ;) ) socket diff-scan This command was sunset in favor of socket scan diff socket info This command was sunset in favor of socket package shallow . Note that there is also socket package score , which will give you a transitive score (the info command was always shallow). The new score commands also supports any ecosystem, whereas the info command was bound to the npm ecosystem. socket organization If you were using socket organization directly for information, you now have to use socket organization list instead. Same otherwise but we removed the toplevel to show help instead. socket organization policy security The command now defaults to the default org setting. It will prompt you if none is set. You can use --no-interactive to prevent this prompt which will cause the command to fail. You can override that and explicitly set the org through the --org flag instead. socket report This command was sunset in favor of socket scan report and socket scan --report socket repos This command was renamed to socket repository (but repos was added as a secret alias ;) ). socket repository create The command now defaults to the default org setting. It will prompt you if none is set. You can use --no-interactive to prevent this prompt which will cause the command to fail. You can override that and explicitly set the org through the --org flag instead. The --repoName flag was removed in favor of the repo being the (mandatory) first arg of the command. This should still be a &quot;slug&quot;. socket repository del The command now defaults to the default org setting. It will prompt you if none is set. You can use --no-interactive to prevent this prompt which will cause the command to fail. You can override that and explicitly set the org through the --org flag instead. The --repoName flag was removed in favor of the repo being the (mandatory) first arg of the command. This should still be a &quot;slug&quot;. socket repository list The command now defaults to the default org setting. It will prompt you if none is set. You can use --no-interactive to prevent this prompt which will cause the command to fail. You can override that and explicitly set the org through the --org flag instead. socket repository update The command now defaults to the default org setting. It will prompt you if none is set. You can use --no-interactive to prevent this prompt which will cause the command to fail. You can override that and explicitly set the org through the --org flag instead. socket repository view The command now defaults to the default org setting. It will prompt you if none is set. You can use --no-interactive to prevent this prompt which will cause the command to fail. You can override that and explicitly set the org through the --org flag instead. socket scan create The command now defaults to the default org setting. It will prompt you if none is set. You can use --no-interactive to prevent this prompt which will cause the command to fail. You can override that and explicitly set the org through the --org flag instead. Note: this command has been expanded with various tools, like generating manifests for certain ecosystem and waiting for the report to complete. The TARGET dir/file is now optional, defaulting to the current dir where you ran the command. Note that controlling the CWD explicitly is still by setting the --cwd flag. socket scan del The command now defaults to the default org setting. It will prompt you if none is set. You can use --no-interactive to prevent this prompt which will cause the command to fail. You can override that and explicitly set the org through the --org flag instead. socket scan list The command now defaults to the default org setting. It will prompt you if none is set. You can use --no-interactive to prevent this prompt which will cause the command to fail. You can override that and explicitly set the org through the --org flag instead. The --repo flag has been changed to the first argument: socket scan list my-repo The --branch flag has been kept but if you specify a repo, you can pass in a second argument as branch name: socket scan list my-repo test-branch . You can still use --branch , which you would need to if you don&#x27;t specify a repo arg. socket scan metadata The command now defaults to the default org setting. It will prompt you if none is set. You can use --no-interactive to prevent this prompt which will cause the command to fail. You can override that and explicitly set the org through the --org flag instead. socket scan report The command now defaults to the default org setting. It will prompt you if none is set. You can use --no-interactive to prevent this prompt which will cause the command to fail. You can override that and explicitly set the org through the --org flag instead. socket scan view The command now defaults to the default org setting. It will prompt you if none is set. You can use --no-interactive to prevent this prompt which will cause the command to fail. You can override that and explicitly set the org through the --org flag instead. socket threat-feed The command now defaults to the default org setting. It will prompt you if none is set. You can use --no-interactive to prevent this prompt which will cause the command to fail. You can override that and explicitly set the org through the --org flag instead. You can specify the filters on the command line now. The CLI will try to detect the type of filter each arg belongs to by matching the value against the enum for ecosystem and filter type, or by checking v?\\d+.\\d+.\\d+ . First value that does not match one of these three becomes the package name filter. socket threat-feed npm eslint 1.0.0 socket thread-feed mal babel socket thread-feed typo log4j Since it&#x27;s inconvenient to search for certain package names this way you can still use the flags too. Args will override flags in case of conflict so if you want to be safe you should use explicitly use flags. This will also allow you to use less common version specifiers or prefixes when you need to. socket threat-feed --eco=npm --name=eslint --version=1.0.0 socket thread-feed --type=mal --name=babel socket thread-feed --type=typo --name=log4j socket wrapper The --enable and --disable flag were replaced by a first argument &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; (or &quot;enable(d)&quot; and &quot;disable(d)&quot; if you prefer).

The file contains project/repository level default override for flags and args. For example, if you do socket scan create --branch=foo , you can instead also run socket scan setup , set a default for the --branch flag to foo , and next time you run socket scan create it will automatically set --branch=foo . And if you use --branch=xyz instead then it will happily use xyz . Each project root dir needs its own socket.json . There is no inheritance or anything fancy. Many things here are specific to a project, anyways. Repo name, branch name, manifest configuration, etc. This file is meant to make your life easier when using the Socket CLI.

See autoManifest flag in `socket scan create` This command is intended to use in CI runs to allow automated systems to accept or reject a current build. When the scan does not pass your security policy, the exit code will be non-zero. It will use the default org for the set API token. The --autoManifest flag does the same as the one from `socket scan create` but is not enabled by default since the CI is less likely to be set up with all the necessary dev tooling. Enable it if you want the scan to include locally generated manifests like for gradle and sbt. Examples $ socket ci $ socket ci --autoManifest This is basically an alias to socket scan create --report . It will create a regular scan, wait for the results, generate a report (similar to socket scan report ), and give you a &quot;health&quot; check. If the Scan is not &quot;healthy&quot;, ie. it has alerts that violate your security or license policy, then the exit code will be non-zero. This should signal your CI environment that the build failed. Useful to eg. quick and easily automate Socket checks in your Continuous Integration runs. You can pre-configure certain pieces of information with socket scan setup which will be stored in socket.json in your project root ( more details ). Exit Code Behavior Code 0 The CLI will exit with a status code of 0 under the following conditions: The command executes successfully without encountering unexpected errors. The report passes your organization security policy and license policy. Non-Zero Exit Code The CLI will return a non-zero exit code in the following scenarios: The generated report returns &quot;healthy&quot;: false An unexpected error occurs during execution.

Available styles: * pin - Use the exact version (e.g. 1.2.3) * preserve - Retain the existing version range style as-is Examples $ socket fix $ socket fix ./proj/tree --auto-merge Overview Socket Fix gives developers a faster, safer way to clear vulnerabilities without endless manual upgrades. With Socket Fix, you can now: Target specific vulnerabilities - Fix the CVEs that matter most to your team Apply fixes locally - Test changes before committing Support multiple ecosystems - Works with npm, pnpm, Yarn, Maven and many more Use intelligent upgrade planning - Finds the least disruptive upgrade path How Socket Fix Works Socket Fix uses an advanced compute-and-apply fix engine to intelligently resolve vulnerabilities: Scans your dependencies - Identifies all vulnerable packages in your project Computes upgrade paths - Determines the minimal set of changes needed to fix vulnerabilities Applies updates - Modifies your manifest and lock files with the secure versions Example Fix Scenario Suppose your application depends on [email&#160;protected] \\ : This version has a dependency constraint of ^1.3.0 on estree-util-value-to-estree ( link ) A vulnerability ( GHSA-f7f6-9jq7-3rqj ) affects all versions of estree-util-value-to-estree below 3.3.3 The patched [email&#160;protected] updates its constraint to ^3.3.3 ( link ) Socket Fix automatically upgrades to [email&#160;protected] to resolve the vulnerability Usage Target Specific Vulnerabilities Fix only specific CVEs or GHSA advisories using the --id flag: Bash # Fix a specific GHSA $ socket fix --id GHSA-hhq3-ff78-jv3g # Fix multiple vulnerabilities $ socket fix --id GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx,GHSA-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy # Using multiple flags $ socket fix --id GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx --id GHSA-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy Fix all CVEs Run socket fix in your project directory to automatically fix all fixable vulnerabilities: Bash $ socket fix Notice: Use this mode with care. Upgrading many dependencies simultaneously makes it difficult to uncover the culprit if something breaks. Developer Workflow The developer-friendly workflow makes it easy to apply fixes locally: Run Socket Fix in your project directory Review the changes to your manifest and lock files Test your application to ensure everything still works Open a pull request with the changes This workflow allows you to: Apply fixes locally before committing Test changes thoroughly Maintain control over what gets merged Document security updates in your commit history Create and Merge PRs (Autopilot Mode) Run socket fix --autopilot in a GitHub action to automatically create PRs with the fixes that merge automatically if all checks pass. Below is an example of how to set up the autopilot fix to run twice a day for a pnpm project: YAML name: Socket Fix on: schedule: - cron: &#x27;0 0 * * *&#x27; - cron: &#x27;0 12 * * *&#x27; permissions: contents: write pull-requests: write jobs: socket-fix: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout repo uses: actions/checkout@08c6903cd8c0fde910a37f88322edcfb5dd907a8 - name: Setup pnpm uses: pnpm/action-setup@a7487c7e89a18df4991f7f222e4898a00d66ddda with: version: &#x27;^10.16.0&#x27; - name: Setup Node.js with pnpm cache uses: actions/setup-node@a0853c24544627f65ddf259abe73b1d18a591444 with: node-version: &quot;22&quot; cache: &#x27;pnpm&#x27; - name: Install dependencies shell: bash run: &gt; pnpm dlx @socketsecurity/cli pnpm install --config &#x27;{&quot;issueRules&quot;:{&quot;malware&quot;:true}}&#x27; - name: Run Socket Fix CLI env: SOCKET_CLI_GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} SOCKET_CLI_GIT_USER_EMAIL: socket-fix[bot]@users.noreply.github.com SOCKET_CLI_GIT_USER_NAME: socket-fix[bot] SOCKET_CLI_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SOCKET_CLI_API_TOKEN }} run: pnpm dlx @socketsecurity/cli fix --autopilot Options --id Target specific vulnerabilities by their identifiers: GHSA IDs : GitHub Security Advisory Database identifiers Bash # Target a specific vulnerability $ socket fix --id GHSA-f7f6-9jq7-3rqj --limit Control how many fixes to attempt at once (default: 10): Bash # Fix up to 5 vulnerabilities $ socket fix --limit 5 # Fix up to 10 vulnerabilities $ socket fix --range-style Define how dependency version ranges are updated: preserve (default): Retains existing version range style pin : Uses exact versions (e.g., 1.2.3 instead of ^1.2.3 ) Bash # Keep existing range style $ socket fix --range-style preserve # Pin to exact versions $ socket fix --range-style pin Output Formats --json Output results in JSON format for programmatic processing: Bash $ socket fix --json --markdown Output results in Markdown format for documentation: Bash $ socket fix --markdown Getting Suggested Fixes --only-compute Computes the dependency upgrades necessary to fix the CVE, but does not apply the upgrades to the project.

While we can process the manifest files (like package.json for npm) on our servers, some languages make this almost impossible without full access to the source code. Generate manifest files In order to work around this socket manifest attempts to offer a way for you to generate the manifest files so you can generate a Scan for them and get a report back from your CI/CD pipeline. socket manifest auto ./proj At the time of writing, there are two ecosystems supported this way: Scala&#x27;s sbt and Gradle. socket manifest gradle ./proj Note: Gradle support implies support for Scala / Kotlin / Maven projects and anything else that uses Gradle. These commands leverage your local environment to generate the necessary manifest files, which you can then upload to get scanned by calling socket scan create on the output directory. You can see detailed help per language by calling help, for example: socket manifest gradle --help We are still improving use of this command. Please let us know if you run into issues and we&#x27;ll try to get them resolved as soon as possible. Default setup You can generate a file that overrides defaults per project by running socket manifest setup ./proj This interactive tool will try to detect eligible languages for which it can generate a manifest. You pick any language, regardless of detection, and then pick defaults for flags if you want to. The result is stored in the root of the dir / project in a file called socket.json ( more details here . You can setup the defaults this way for multiple languages per project dir. These defaults are picked up when you run the manifest generator directly (ie. socket manifest gradle ./proj will apply defaults defined in ./proj/socket.json ) but also socket manifest auto and something like socket scan create --auto-manifest would leverage these defaults. Generate and scan Once you&#x27;ve setup the manifest defaults for the languages you want to target you can generate the manifest files and run a scan in one go by running socket scan create --auto-manifest ./proj This will first run the equivalent to socket manifest auto ./proj , which in turn will try to detect the eligible files in your target directory, generate manifests for languages it found ( applying socket.json if available ), and then proceed with a regular socket scan create to upload the generated manifest files to do a scan. CycloneDX There is another tool that this command exposes: CycloneDX.

During this beta, these integrations do not perform authentication against organizations, do not use socket.yml , and are limited to default issue sets. Windows support is limited to WSL for now. These integrations act the same as npm and npx and do not use command line flags. Additionally, for some tooling that needs to run these as a single bin, aliases as socket-npm and socket-npx are made available upon installation. $ socket npm --help npm wrapper functionality Usage $ socket npm ... This runs npm but checks packages through Socket before installing anything. See docs for more details. Note: Everything after &quot;npm&quot; is sent straight to the npm command. Only the `--dryRun` and `--help` flags are caught here. Use `socket wrapper on` to automatically enable this such that you don&#x27;t have to write `socket npm` for that purpose. Examples $ socket npm $ socket npm install -g socket socket npm [args...] and socket npm [args...] Calls npm and npx and checks all packages with Socket before they get installed so you can be prevent installing malicious packages. Uses the builtin resolution of npm to precisely determine package installations. socket wrapper --enabled When you enable the wrapper like this we create an alias in your system to run socket npm whenever you would run npm . Same for npx . FAQ Not seeing an alert with socket npm install foo We only prompt for accepting the risk of installing packages for those that we alert on. Additionally, if you have already installed a package at a different version and it shares the same issue as the version you are installing, we do not prompt. NOTE: In the beta you cannot configure what is considered to be an issue. Issues will always use our default issue set. Seeing alerts with socket npm rm foo OR Seeing alerts for an unrelated package with socket npm install foo One might think that removing a package reduces vulnerabilities, however with package management this is not so straight forward. npm normally creates what is called the ideal tree for a given package.json by removing a package you might actually change what the ideal tree is! If foo depends on [email&#160;protected] it will constrain bar to be on 1.1.x but a different dependency baz might depend on on [email&#160;protected] which constrains bar to any version 1.x.x . If [email&#160;protected] exists it would be available only to upgrade if bar is removed from the package.json ! This ideal tree also performs things like automatic updates when using npm install in its default configuration. If a package bar exists in your package.json it will automatically be updated upon being found even if what is being installed is unrelated to bar in any way. Aliasing as npm or npx socket npm will automatically detect if it is in front of npm in the PATH variable, and if it is not it will prepend itself to the PATH to intercept commands. This means if you use something like socket npm run script-with-npx it will already intercept npx without you needing to change your package.json . For people wishing to avoid typing out socket npm a shell alias like the following in your .bashrc or .zsh . This is what socket wrapper --enable would do for you: Shell alias npm=&quot;socket-npm&quot; alias npx=&quot;socket-npx&quot; For zsh autocompletions you may wish to add the following as well. Zsh compdef _npm socket-npm For bash autocompletions you may wish to add the following as well. Bash $(complete -p npm | sed &#x27;s/npm$/socket-npm/&#x27;) Combining with npq npq , an alternative CLI to perform pre-install syntactic and CVE checks, does not directly integrate into a package manager for installation. You can configure the environment variable NPQ_PKG_MGR=socket-npm and alias alias yarn=&quot;NPQ_PKG_MGR=yarn npq-hero&quot; to use both. NOTE: Due to socket npm doing a full transitive scan and integrating into npm it is expected that npq will be faster since it is doing less.

Before we cover that we should mention what a &quot;purl&quot; is. PURL A PURL is a string that conforms to a specification for a &quot;package URL&quot; which is a general way to name a package in such a way that it can be recognized and that there can be no ambiguity about the ecosystem, package name, or version. An example would be pkg:npm/socket or pkg:pypi/pip . In docs we may casually refer to a &quot;purl&quot; just like you would when you say &quot;url&quot; for any website. Shallow score When the score only applies to the package itself and not its direct or transitive dependencies then it&#x27;s a shallow score. It simply applies to the software that was written by that dev or vendor, not the other packages it may also depend on. To get shallow package scores for multiple packages you can use the socket package shallow command. It supports two ways; you start by specifying an ecosystem and then any number of packages $ socket package shallow npm babel [email&#160;protected] ℹ Requesting shallow score data for 2 package urls (purl): pkg:npm/babel, pkg:npm/ [email&#160;protected] ✔ Received API response (after requesting looking up package). Shallow Package Score Please note: The listed scores are ONLY for the package itself. It does NOT reflect the scores of any dependencies, transitive or otherwise.

Deep score In general when people want to know the score of a package they are talking about the package as a whole, so including any software that shipped with it. This leads us to a &quot;deep&quot; score, or a &quot;transitive&quot; score. This kind of score reflects the whole package as it gets shipped, including its direct dependencies, the dependencies that those depend on, and so forth. That&#x27;s also called &quot;transitive dependencies&quot;. To get the transitive dependency score for a package you can use two ways, similar as for the shallow score above: you start with the ecosystem followed by the package your want to inspect $ socket package deep npm eslint --markdown ℹ Requesting deep score data for this purl: pkg:npm/eslint ✔ Received API response (after requesting the deep package scores). ✔ Score report for &quot;pkg:npm/eslint&quot; (&quot;npm/ [email&#160;protected] &quot;): # Complete Package Score This is a Socket report for the package *&quot;npm/ [email&#160;protected] &quot;* and its *86* direct/transitive dependencies.

You can see a list of scans in your org. You can also setup defaults for working with these sub-commands. socket scan create This is probably the core command for this CLI. As the name suggests it creates a new scan. There&#x27;s a few ways you can go about doing this; $ socket scan create --help Create a new Socket scan and report Usage $ socket scan create [options] [TARGET...] API Token Requirements - Quota: 1 unit - Permissions: full-scans:create Options --auto-manifest Run `socket manifest auto` before collecting manifest files. This is necessary for languages like Scala, Gradle, and Kotlin, See `socket manifest auto --help`. --branch Branch name --commit-hash Commit hash --commit-message Commit message --committers Committers --cwd working directory, defaults to process.cwd() --default-branch Set the default branch of the repository to the branch of this full-scan. Should only need to be done once, for example for the &quot;main&quot; or &quot;master&quot; branch. --interactive Allow for interactive elements, asking for input. Use --no-interactive to prevent any input questions, defaulting them to cancel/no. --json Output result as json --markdown Output result as markdown --org Force override the organization slug, overrides the default org from config --pull-request Pull request number --reach Run tier 1 full application reachability analysis --read-only Similar to --dry-run except it can read from remote, stops before it would create an actual report --repo Repository name --report Wait for the scan creation to complete, then basically run `socket scan report` on it --set-as-alerts-page When true and if this is the &quot;default branch&quot; then this Scan will be the one reflected on your alerts page. See help for details. Defaults to true. --tmp Set the visibility (true/false) of the scan in your dashboard. Reachability Options (when --reach is used) --reach-analysis-memory-limit The maximum memory in MB to use for the reachability analysis. The default is 8192MB. --reach-analysis-timeout Set timeout for the reachability analysis. Split analysis runs may cause the total scan time to exceed this timeout significantly. --reach-disable-analytics Disable reachability analytics sharing with Socket. Also disables caching-based optimizations. --reach-ecosystems List of ecosystems to conduct reachability analysis on, as either a comma separated value or as multiple flags. Defaults to all ecosystems. --reach-exclude-paths List of paths to exclude from reachability analysis, as either a comma separated value or as multiple flags. Uploads the specified dependency manifest files for Go, Gradle, JavaScript, Kotlin, Python, and Scala. Files like &quot;package.json&quot; and &quot;requirements.txt&quot;. If any folder is specified, the ones found in there recursively are uploaded. Details on TARGET: - Defaults to the current dir (cwd) if none given - Multiple targets can be specified - If a target is a file, only that file is checked - If it is a dir, the dir is scanned for any supported manifest files - Dirs MUST be within the current dir (cwd), you can use --cwd to change it - Supports globbing such as &quot;**/package.json&quot;, &quot;**/requirements.txt&quot;, etc. - Ignores any file specified in your project&#x27;s &quot;.gitignore&quot; - Also a sensible set of default ignores from the &quot;ignore-by-default&quot; module The --repo and --branch flags tell Socket to associate this Scan with that repo/branch. The names will show up on your dashboard on the Socket website. Note: for a first run you probably want to set --default-branch to indicate the default branch name, like &quot;main&quot; or &quot;master&quot;. The &quot;alerts page&quot; (https://socket.dev/dashboard/org/YOURORG/alerts) will show the results from the last scan designated as the &quot;pending head&quot; on the branch configured on Socket to be the &quot;default branch&quot;. When creating a scan the --set-as-alerts-page flag will default to true to update this. You can prevent this by using --no-set-as-alerts-page. This flag is ignored for any branch that is not designated as the &quot;default branch&quot;. It is disabled when using --tmp. You can use `socket scan setup` to configure certain repo flag defaults. Examples $ socket scan create $ socket scan create ./proj --json $ socket scan create --repo=test-repo --branch=main ./package.json Basic scan socket scan create It will search your target directory for all manifest files that we support ( that&#x27;s requirements.txt , package.json , pom.xml , etc. ) and upload them to Socket. No real source code just meta data about which packages your project depends on. The server will respond with a URL for this Scan that you can access while it works on processing the Scan. It may not be done yet when you visit it. When it&#x27;s ready, this page will tell you the result. Report socket scan create --report This starts with a basic Scan. The server is then polled for completion. Once completed it downloads the report and holds any alerts that may surface against the security and license policy set by your organization. When any alert violates any of these, the output will tell you with a &quot;healthy&quot; indicator. Additionally, the exit code will reflect whether or not the Scan passed your org policies. With generated manifests For certain languages we must generate concrete manifest files because the language itself does not have them. Two current examples are Scala&#x27;s sbt and gradle (leveraged by Java, Kotlin, Scala). These &quot;manifests&quot; are dynamic code that requires an unpredictable amount of files to collect as manifest files so instead we leverage the local build setup to generate the manifest files and scan those. See the socket manifest page for details. With Tier 1 full application reachability analysis socket scan create --reach This starts with a basic Scan. It then runs a static code analysis on your code and the code of your dependencies to determine the reachability of CVEs. You can filter on &#x27;CVE Reachability&#x27; when you view the scan in the dashboard. Additionally, it writes a .socket.facts.json file to your project folder that contains the reachability data. Repo / Branch names --repo tells Socket to which repository this Scan belongs (default: socket-default-repository ) --branch tells Socket to which branch this Scan belongs (default: socket-default-branch ) Repo names are required to follow these rules: Only a-z A-Z 0-9 and . , _ , and - are allowed Max length is 100 Branch names are required to follow these rules, which should be roughly equal to GitHub&#x27;s branch names: be 1–255 characters long cannot be exactly @ or 0 cannot begin or end with / , . , or .lock cannot contain // , .. , @{ , any control characters, spaces, or any of ; ~ ^ : ? * [ . Head Scan A concept currently called Head Scan is the scan that currently reflects the &quot;dependencies&quot; and &quot;alerts&quot; page in your dashboard. This must be a Scan on the &quot;default&quot; branch in a project. Default branch Very similar to how branches in a git repository have a default branch, so do repositories on Socket have a default branch for each repository. You can mark a repository as default branch by setting a flag. You only need to do this once per repo. socket scan diff If you want to know what changed between two commits you can check a scan diff. This will take two Scan ID and compute the delta between the before and after Scan, then tell you exactly what changed in terms of dependencies and alerts. $ socket scan diff --help See what changed between two Scans Usage $ socket scan diff [options] &lt;SCAN_ID1&gt; &lt;SCAN_ID2&gt; API Token Requirements - Quota: 1 unit - Permissions: full-scans:list This command displays the package changes between two scans. The full output can be pretty large depending on the size of your repo and time range. It is best stored to disk (with --json) to be further analyzed by other tools. Note: While it will work in any order, the first Scan ID is assumed to be the older ID, even if it is a newer Scan. This is only relevant for the added/removed list (similar to diffing two files with git). Options --depth Max depth of JSON to display before truncating, use zero for no limit (without --json/--file) --file Path to a local file where the output should be saved. Use `-` to force stdout. --interactive Allow for interactive elements, asking for input. Use --no-interactive to prevent any input questions, defaulting them to cancel/no. --json Output result as json --markdown Output result as markdown --org Force override the organization slug, overrides the default org from config Examples $ socket scan diff aaa0aa0a-aaaa-0000-0a0a-0000000a00a0 aaa1aa1a-aaaa-1111-1a1a-1111111a11a1 $ socket scan diff aaa0aa0a-aaaa-0000-0a0a-0000000a00a0 aaa1aa1a-aaaa-1111-1a1a-1111111a11a1 --json socket report This downloads a Scan and the security / license policies set by your organization and checks whether the Scan had any alerts that might violate any rules in those policies. $ socket scan report --help Check whether a scan result passes the organizational policies (security, license) Usage $ socket scan report [options] &lt;SCAN_ID&gt; [OUTPUT_PATH] API Token Requirements - Quota: 2 units - Permissions: full-scans:list security-policy:read Options --fold Fold reported alerts to some degree --interactive Allow for interactive elements, asking for input. Use --no-interactive to prevent any input questions, defaulting them to cancel/no. --json Output result as json --license Also report the license policy status. Default: false --markdown Output result as markdown --org Force override the organization slug, overrides the default org from config --reportLevel Which policy level alerts should be reported --short Report only the healthy status When no output path is given the contents is sent to stdout. By default the result is a nested object that looks like this: `{ [ecosystem]: { [pkgName]: { [version]: { [file]: { [line:col]: alert }}}}` So one alert for each occurrence in every file, version, etc, a huge response. You can --fold these up to given level: &#x27;pkg&#x27;, &#x27;version&#x27;, &#x27;file&#x27;, and &#x27;none&#x27;. For example: `socket scan report --fold=version` will dedupe alerts to only show one alert of a particular kind, no matter how often it was foud in a file or in how many files it was found. At most one per version that has it. By default only the warn and error policy level alerts are reported. You can override this and request more (&#x27;defer&#x27; &lt; &#x27;ignore&#x27; &lt; &#x27;monitor&#x27; &lt; &#x27;warn&#x27; &lt; &#x27;error&#x27;) Short responses look like this: --json: `{healthy:bool}` --markdown: `healthy = bool` neither: `OK/ERR` Examples $ socket scan report 000aaaa1-0000-0a0a-00a0-00a0000000a0 --json --fold=version $ socket scan report 000aaaa1-0000-0a0a-00a0-00a0000000a0 --license --markdown --short Here&#x27;s what that would kind of look like: $ socket scan report 000aaaa1-0000-0a0a-00a0-00a0000000a0 ℹ Scan result: success. Security policy: received policy. ✔ Generated reported in 1 ms { healthy: true, orgSlug: &#x27;bearDev&#x27;, scanId: &#x27;000aaaa1-0000-0a0a-00a0-00a0000000a0&#x27;, options: { fold: &#x27;none&#x27;, reportLevel: &#x27;warn&#x27; }, alerts: Map(0) {} } The report will include the alerts and a simple boolean flag for whether the report passes or not, called &quot;healthy&quot;. View / Del / Metadata There are a few commands to organize Scans in your repository. These are fairly straightforward. Setup defaults You can start an interactive prompt to generate a socket.json in your target directory with defaults for running scans in this directory. ( More details here ) socket scan setup ./proj This is helpful for setting up defaults for flags like --repo (the name of the repo of this directory), --branch the name of (presumably default) branch of this directory. And a few more. This way, you can just do socket scan create ./proj and it could prefill --repo website --branch main for you. Automation Note that most of these commands support --json for a raw payload (which you can forward to jq ) --markdown for easy sharing Automation While we try to offer simpler ways of combining these commands, like socket ci and socket scan create --report , we recognize that there may always be desires to customize your chain. And that&#x27;s totally fine! Here is an automation example of running it as part of your CI logic socket scan create \\ --report \\ --repo=&quot;$CI_PROJECT_NAME&quot; \\ --branch=&quot;$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME&quot; \\ ./proj This will create the scan on the ./proj directory, wait for the report, and have exit code 0 for success or 1 if the Scan does not pass your security policy or license policy (or if an error occurred) . Make sure you set the env vars to the appropriate values. For example, GitLab should expose the CI_PROJECT_NAME variable. Each environment will have their own set of env vars exposed.

Examples $ socket wrapper on $ socket wrapper off Once enabled, running npm ... on your system should actually run socket npm ... and make sure installed packages are safe. Installation We leverage shell aliases and your RC file (like .bashrc ) to make this work. When you run socket manifest you still need to &quot;finish&quot; the installation before the change takes effect, regardless of whether you&#x27;re turning it on or off. This is a limitation of how a &quot;shell&quot; works that we can&#x27;t circumvent: we cannot change aliases in your current terminal(s) because any command we would run, would run in a new shell. As such, changes in command aliases only take effect after (re)starting a terminal or by &quot;sourcing&quot; your RC file (like source ~/.bashrc in bash). Future terminal sessions will start by reading your RC so that&#x27;s covered. Updated 4 days ago socket threat-feed socket fix Ask AI",

While open-source software drives innovation, it also presents challenges, particularly around security vulnerabilities and license compliance. Managing these risks is especially daunting in large projects with numerous dependencies. To address these challenges, Socket introduces License Enforcement —a major advancement in our mission to provide comprehensive software supply chain security. Key Features of License Enforcement 1. Comprehensive License Detection Socket’s advanced system identifies over 800 license types, providing unmatched coverage. Whether you’re dealing with widely-used licenses or more obscure ones, Socket ensures you&#x27;re protected with reliable license detection. 2. Detailed Provenance Information Understanding the origin of a license violation is critical. Socket provides detailed provenance data, tracing the origin of potential license issues directly to their source. This granular information helps teams make informed decisions about which software components to integrate into their projects. 3. Accuracy You Can Trust Socket offers one of the most accurate license detection tools in the industry. By employing a meticulous scanning process, we ensure that no critical compliance issues are overlooked. Read more about our state-of-the-art license scanner to explore its accuracy and capabilities. 4. Pre-Merge Compliance Checks Socket’s License Enforcement feature helps prevent non-compliant code from entering your codebase. By detecting potential license violations in Pull Requests (PRs), it ensures that problematic code never gets merged, streamlining the development process while safeguarding your software’s compliance. License Categories and Actions Socket categorizes licenses based on their permissiveness, restrictions, and risk, offering flexibility in policy enforcement. These categories include: Permissive Licenses ✅ Broadly allow usage, modification, and redistribution with minimal restrictions. Default Action : Generally allowed by most organizations. Examples : MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD Weak Copyleft Licenses ⚠️ Require changes and additions to the software to be shared under the same license terms but with fewer restrictions than strong copyleft. Default Action : Organizations may choose to allow or deny based on their compliance requirements. Examples : LGPL, MPL Strong Copyleft Licenses ⚠️ Imposes more restrictions, requiring derived work to be licensed under the same terms. Default Action : Typically denied by companies working on proprietary software due to its strict sharing requirements. Examples : GPL, AGPL Lead Category Licenses ⚠️ These licenses lack essential elements of permissive licenses or impose unusually burdensome requirements. Default Action : Often denied to minimize legal and compliance risks. Examples : Adobe Glyph License, Aladdin Free Public License License Enforcement Actions With Socket’s License Enforcement, you can tailor how your organization handles license violations based on its risk tolerance. Actions include: Block 🚫 Prevents the merge of any PR introducing a license violation. Ideal for high-risk licenses such as Strong Copyleft or known non-compliant licenses. Example : GPL License being blocked in a proprietary software project. Warn ❗ Flags potential license violations but allows PRs to proceed. Suitable for licenses that might pose moderate risks but don’t require an immediate block. Example : LGPL flagged as a warning but not blocked for internal tools. Monitor 👁️ Tracks license violations without alerting developers or blocking PRs. Useful for licenses that require ongoing observation but don’t present immediate risk. Example : Monitoring permissive licenses that may require further review. Setting Up License Enforcement Follow these simple steps to configure and enable License Enforcement in your Socket dashboard: Access License Policy : Navigate to the License Policy page from your Socket dashboard to view and configure your license rules. Quick Setup : Use the quick setup to apply default rules based on Blue Oak Tiers and common license categories. This is a great starting point for organizations new to managing open-source licenses. Define Custom Rules : After the quick setup, you can fine-tune individual licenses by specifying whether to allow or deny specific ones. This is especially useful for organizations with custom compliance needs. Configure Enforcement Levels : Customize how strictly you want to enforce the policy: Block PRs that violate your organization’s license policy. Warn developers through PR comments. Monitor license issues without alerting developers or blocking PRs. Integration into Existing Workflows Socket’s License Enforcement integrates seamlessly into your development workflows, providing real-time alerts in your GitHub PRs: Alert Generation : License violation alerts are treated like any other Socket alert. Depending on your organization’s configuration, these alerts can Block , Warn , or Monitor potential issues. GitHub PR Integration : License violation alerts will appear in GitHub PR comments with detailed provenance data, allowing developers to review and resolve issues in real-time. Allow/Deny List Approach : Tailor your license policy to your organization’s needs by maintaining a simple allow/deny list. Example of License Setup in Socket: In this example: Permissive Licenses like MIT and Apache 2.0 are allowed. Strong Copyleft Licenses like GPL are denied due to stricter redistribution rules. Licenses like Lead Category are set to deny due to burdensome requirements. Conclusion The License Policy feature in Socket ensures that you maintain control over the open-source licenses permitted in your codebase, reducing the risk of using non-compliant or restrictive licenses. By setting appropriate actions for each license type, you can enforce your organization&#x27;s policies and compliance frameworks effectively.

This powerful tool helps you identify and address potential security risks in real-time, ensuring your software supply chain remains secure. Overview of Organizational Alerts Organizational Alerts in Socket provide a centralized view of security alerts detected across your organization&#x27;s repositories. This feature is designed to help DevSecOps teams prioritize and manage security concerns efficiently, ensuring that critical vulnerabilities and risks are addressed promptly. This documentation will guide you through the features and functionalities of Organizational Alerts and how they can be leveraged to maintain a secure codebase. Accessing Organizational Alerts To access Organizational Alerts, navigate to the &#x27;Alerts&#x27; section in the Socket dashboard. Here, you will find a summary of the alerts detected across all repositories, categorized by severity. Features of Organizational Alerts Centralized Alert Management Organizational Alerts aggregate security alerts from all repositories within your organization, providing a comprehensive overview of potential risks. This centralized view helps streamline the process of identifying and addressing security issues. Triage and Prioritization The alerts are categorized by severity—Critical, High, Medium, and Low—enabling your team to prioritize response efforts effectively. Critical alerts, such as known malware or critical CVEs, are highlighted to ensure immediate attention. Interactive Dashboard The interactive dashboard displays a visual representation of alerts, making it easier to understand the distribution and severity of security issues across your repositories. You can filter alerts by repository, ecosystem, severity, category, type, and dependency to focus on specific areas of concern. How Organizational Alerts Help DevSecOps Teams Prioritizing Critical Issues The ability to filter and categorize alerts by severity allows DevSecOps teams to focus on addressing the most critical security concerns first, such as known malware and critical CVEs. This ensures that the most significant risks are mitigated promptly. Enhancing Security Posture By utilizing the Block action for high-confidence and severe issues, organizations can prevent potentially harmful code from being merged into the codebase. This proactive approach helps maintain a robust security posture. Streamlining Alert Management The interactive dashboard and comprehensive alert management features streamline the process of identifying, triaging, and addressing security issues. This helps teams stay organized and ensures that no critical alerts are overlooked. Visual Representation of Organizational Alerts The dashboard provides a visual representation of the alerts detected within the default branch of your organization&#x27;s repositories. You can customize your Security Policy to specify which alert types your organization should be notified about. Ignored alert types are hidden by default from the alert table view. Analytics Socket&#x27;s Analytics view provides high-level visibility into the state of your organization&#x27;s software supply chain. It is especially useful for Security and Engineering leaders to understand trends, triage volume, and overall risk posture over time. This data helps you track improvement, spot regressions, and better allocate security and developer resources. Populating Organizational Alerts Organizational Alerts are an essential feature for monitoring the security and integrity of your projects. When enabling Socket, it is important to note that scans for all repositories do not occur immediately. Socket currently does not initiate a scan until there is a commit or a pull request (PR) containing manifest files that Socket supports. For instance, if there is a PR where files like package-lock.json , requirements.txt , or other supported manifest files are present, a scan will automatically be performed. To have results show up for the repositories, you need to make a new commit or PR with any supported manifest files. This action will trigger scans to be populated for the repositories. Currently, Org Alerts are not populated unless a PR is merged into the default branch, which is configured in GitHub. Once this happens, it can take 15 minutes to an hour for the Org Alerts to populate. Please note the following conditions under which Organizational Alerts are populated: PR Merges into the Default Branch Organizational Alerts will only populate once a pull request (PR) has been merged into the default branch. This ensures that alerts are relevant to the current state of your codebase. Full Scan API Usage Alternatively, Organizational Alerts can be populated using the Full Scan API. For this to happen, the scan must be marked with the parameters make_default_branch and set_as_pending_head . This approach allows for more immediate and comprehensive scanning results to be reflected in your Organizational Alerts. By adhering to these conditions, you can ensure that your Organizational Alerts provide the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the security status of your organization’s projects. Severity Categories Organizational Alerts are categorized into four severity levels to help you prioritize response efforts: Critical : Immediate action required to prevent significant security risks. High : Prompt attention required for potential serious issues. Medium : Regular monitoring recommended for known issues. Low : Informational alerts that do not require immediate action. Managing Alerts Socket provides various alert actions to manage alerts effectively. These actions include: Block, Warn, Monitor, and Ignore. Block 🚫 : Immediately block the package from use. Critical alerts like known malware and potential typo squats should be blocked to prevent security breaches. Warn ⚠️ : Notify the team to review the package. High-risk alerts like telemetry and protestware are flagged for review. Monitor 👁️ : Track the package over time without immediate action. Medium risk alerts such as environment variable access and filesystem access are monitored for changes. Ignore ❌ : Ignore the alert if it is deemed low priority or informational. Example Alerts and Actions These actions allow you to tailor the handling of each alert type according to its severity and impact on your project. Block 🚫 Alert Category Severity Action Link Known Malware Supply Chain Risk Critical Block immediately. Notify the team. Learn more Potential Typo Squat Supply Chain Risk Critical Verify and block. Notify the team. Learn more Warn ⚠️ Alert Category Severity Action Link Telemetry Supply Chain Risk High Review data tracking. Notify the team. Learn more Protestware Supply Chain Risk High Examine and replace if necessary. Learn more Monitor 👁️ Alert Category Severity Action Link Environment Variable Access Supply Chain Risk Medium Monitor and ensure safe usage. Learn more Filesystem Access Supply Chain Risk Medium Monitor for unusual activity. Learn more Ignore ❌ Alert Category Severity Action Link Non-existent Author Supply Chain Risk Medium Investigate and monitor usage. Learn more Minified Code Quality Low Review source if possible. Learn more Customizing Security Policies Organizations can customize their security policies to tailor alert actions according to their specific needs. This can be done through the dashboard for granular control at the repository level. Using the Dashboard To customize your security policy using the dashboard: Navigate to the &#x27;Security Policy&#x27; section. Select the alerts you wish to modify. Choose the desired action (Block, Warn, Monitor, Ignore). Example of a Socket Dependency Overview Comment This is an example of a Socket Dependency Overview comment. The dependency overview comments appear where there is either a new dependency, an updated dependency that adds new capabilities, or there are removed dependencies. This type of comment is an informational type to provide additional insight into what your dependencies are adding in. For example, you might want to look at why a simple parser might be adding in network or shell capabilities when you aren&#x27;t expecting it. You can follow the links for the capabilities and we try to highlight right in the code where this detection was. Socket&#x27;s goal is to do the scanning and evaluation of the packages for you so that you don&#x27;t need to read every line of code for direct or transitive dependencies. Example of a Socket Security Issue Comment This screenshot is of a Socket Security Issue comment. When there are items that the Security Team has added to the Warn or Block security policies within Socket it will trigger these types of comments. Warn Alerts will comment on the PR but will not fail the Socket Security: Pull Request Alerts check. Block Alerts will comment on the PR and WILL fail the Socket Github check. If there are branch protection rules configured for the repository that either all checks must pass or specifically the Socket Pull Request Alert then the merge would be blocked. If this branch protection rule is not configured then it is possible to still merge. Conclusion Socket&#x27;s Organizational Alerts provide a robust framework for securing your software supply chain. By leveraging the power of real-time alerts, severity-based categorization, and customizable security policies, you can proactively manage risks and ensure the integrity of your codebase.

Explicit Setting: Remains constant regardless of policy changes, offering tailored customization. Detailed Breakdown of Default Alert Actions The table below outlines the alert types and their corresponding actions under each security policy: Alert Type Low Noise (SCA) Default Higher Noise Known Malware 🚫 🚫 🚫 Critical CVE ❗ ❗ 🚫 Git Dependency ➖ ❗ 🚫 GitHub Dependency ➖ ❗ 🚫 HTTP Dependency ➖ ❗ 🚫 Possible Typosquat Attack ➖ ❗ ❗ Protestware/Troll Package ➖ ❗ ❗ Obfuscated File ➖ ❗ ❗ Telemetry ➖ 👁️ ❗ Unpublished Package ➖ 👁️ ❗ Unpopular Package ➖ 👁️ ❗ Unstable Ownership ➖ 👁️ ❗ Deprecated ➖ 👁️ ❗ Shrinkwrap ➖ 👁️ ❗ High CVE 👁️ 👁️ ❗ Medium CVE 👁️ 👁️ 👁️ Low CVE 👁️ 👁️ 👁️ Install Scripts ➖ ➖ 👁️ Unmaintained ➖ ➖ 👁️ Potential Vulnerability ➖ ➖ 👁️ AI-Detected Potential Malware ➖ ➖ 👁️ Alert Actions Alert Action Shows up in Dashboard Developers see it (e.g., GitHub comment, CLI prints a warning) Developers blocked (GitHub PR fails, CLI errors) Block 🚫 ✅ ✅ ✅ Warn ❗ ✅ ✅ ❌ Monitor 👁️ ✅ ❌ ❌ Ignore ➖ ❌ ❌ ❌ Legend Block 🚫 : This action will fail the Socket CI/CD check, preventing the merge or deployment process until the issue is resolved. All related alerts will appear in the dashboard, developers will be notified, and further actions will be blocked. Warn ❗ : This action indicates a potential issue that should be reviewed. It will appear in the dashboard and notify developers through comments or warnings, but it will not block the development process. Monitor 👁️ : This action is used for tracking alerts that require monitoring over time. Alerts will be visible in the dashboard, but no notifications will be sent to developers, and it won&#x27;t block any processes. Ignore ➖ : This action is set for low-priority alerts or informational notifications. The alerts will not show up in the dashboard, and there will be no notifications or blocks applied. Note: all other of our supported alert types are set to be ignored in the three new policies and will have to be enabled explicitly. Changes in the New Default Policy CVE Handling: Increased visibility for critical to low CVEs. Supply Chain Risks: Adjusted alert actions to minimize unnecessary disruptions. Quality and Maintenance: Expanded monitoring for potential issues like deprecated or unmaintained packages. Action Steps for Organizations Review Changes: Understand how the new default policy affects your organization. Lock In Preferences: Set explicit actions for critical alerts to maintain current settings. Switch Between Policies: Choose between Low Noise, Default, or Higher Noise based on your team’s needs. Transition to New Policies Transition Period ( August 14 - August 28, 2024 ): Organizations can review changes and lock in existing settings if needed.

API Token Scopes Scope Description alerts:list List all alerts. alerts:trend View alert trend reports over time. api-tokens:create Create API tokens. api-tokens:update Update API tokens. api-tokens:revoke Revoke API tokens. api-tokens:rotate Rotate API tokens. api-tokens:list List all API tokens. audit-log:list List audit log events. dependencies:list List dependencies. dependencies:trend View dependency trend reports. full-scans:list List full scans. full-scans:create Create full scans. full-scans:delete Delete full scans. historical:snapshots-list List metadata for periodic historical snapshots. historical:snapshots-start Start a new historical snapshot job. historical:alerts-list List historical alerts. historical:alerts-trend View historical alert trend reports. historical:dependencies-list List historical dependencies. historical:dependencies-trend View historical dependency trend reports. integration:list List integrations. integration:create Create integrations. integration:update Update integrations. integration:delete Delete integrations. license-policy:update Update license policies. license-policy:read Read license policies. packages:list List package metadata. report:list List reports. report:read Read report data. report:write Create reports. repo:list List repositories. repo:create Create repositories. repo:update Update repositories. repo:delete Delete repositories. security-policy:update Update security policies. security-policy:read Read security policies. threat-feed:list List threat feed items. triage:alerts-list List alert triage states. triage:alerts-update Update alert triage states. Example Usage A security team may wish to create a list of restricted tokens available by default general consumption on machines with limited privileges. The security team creates an API token in the Socket dashboard. The security team edits the scopes of the API token in the Socket dashboard to only have report:read and report:write . The security team gives the API token to developers wishing to run reports locally. The developers can create reports without being able to see reports generated by other developers. Visibility API Tokens can be shown to different groups of people depending upon their visibility settings. This visibility can be changed in the dashboard using the menu for editing API tokens. Visibility Description Admin only ( default ) Only administrators of the Socket organization can view the API token and copy its value. Organization members All users that have joined the Socket organization can view the API token and copy its value. The visibility of a token does not grant the capability to edit a token. Only organization administrators can create or edit API tokens. Example Usage A security team may wish to allow developers to get a list of self service API tokens from Socket&#x27;s dashboard without intervention by the security team. The security team creates an API token in the Socket dashboard. The security team ensure the API token has the correct scopes. The security team changes the API token visibility to be viewable by all members of the Socket organization. The security team invites people as members to the Socket organization either by email, or by GitHub integration automatically. These people can join the organization as members by accepting the invitation. These members see the API tokens by visiting the Socket dashboard. Rotation API Tokens can be shown to disabled and forcibly rotated in the case of incidents requiring action. In case of such an incident if a team needs to rotate API tokens, they can go to the dashboard and individually rotate keys one at a time using the menu for editing API tokens. Rotating an API token will preserve its name, visibility, and scopes. Please note that if an API token is visible to a user in the dashboard it will remain visible even after rotation. To prevent tokens from being visible during or after rotation please edit the visibility first before rotating the API token.

Enabling branch protection and making Socket a required GitHub check is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of your codebase. This process ensures that no code can be merged into your protected branches without passing the Socket security checks, thereby enforcing rigorous security standards. Steps to Enable Branch Protection Navigate to Repository Settings: Go to your GitHub repository. Click on the Settings tab, located at the top of the repository page. Access Branch Protection Rules: In the left sidebar, click on Branches under the Code and automation section. Scroll down to the Branch protection rules section and click on Add rule . Create a Branch Protection Rule: In the Branch name pattern field, specify the branch you want to protect (e.g., main , master , or develop ). Check the box for Require status checks to pass before merging . Set Required Status Checks: After checking Require status checks to pass before merging , a list of available status checks will appear. Locate Socket Security: Pull Request Alerts in the list and check it. This will make the Socket check mandatory for merges. Optionally, you can also select Require branches to be up to date before merging to ensure that the branch is up-to-date with the base branch before merging. Save Changes: Scroll down and click on Create or Save changes to apply the branch protection rule. Example Configuration Here is a typical configuration for protecting the main branch: Branch name pattern: main Protect matching branches: ✅ Checked Require pull request reviews before merging: ✅ Checked Require status checks to pass before merging: ✅ Checked Status checks that are required: Socket Security: Pull Request Alerts Require branches to be up to date before merging: ✅ Checked Include administrators: Optional, depending on whether you want admins to bypass these rules. Additional Notes Socket Integration: Ensure that Socket is properly integrated with your GitHub repository. If you haven&#x27;t already, install the Socket GitHub app from the GitHub Marketplace and configure it to monitor your repository. Managing Alerts: Regularly review and triage alerts generated by Socket to maintain the security of your codebase. Utilize Socket&#x27;s features to block, warn, monitor, or ignore specific alerts based on their severity and relevance to your project. Conclusion By enabling branch protection and making Socket a required GitHub check, you enforce stringent security measures and maintain high standards for code quality and security. This setup helps in proactively identifying and mitigating security risks, thereby ensuring the integrity of your software development lifecycle.

Marking a dependency as ignored will rerun the pull request alert report and the dependency will be excluded from the new result. This can be useful if the repository utilizes protected branches that require all checks to pass, and you accept the implications of merging a given dependency change. Bot commands are issued by a repository contributor by writing a new comment in the pull request discussion, like this: @SocketSecurity ignore [email&#160;protected] [email&#160;protected] [email&#160;protected] Bot commands start with @SocketSecurity ignore followed by a space separated list of package-name@version specifiers. 🚧 Note Bot commands must be the very first thing written in a comment, must be made by a contributor on the repo and can only be written in comments to the main pull request thread. 📘 Good to know Reports check the state of the pull request discussion whenever they are run, so re-running older check runs will take into account all the bot commands currently present in the pull request thread. 📘 Multiple comments possible Pull requests are allowed to have more than one bot command comment in them. All such comments will be taken into account. Un-ignoring To un-ignore a package, edit or delete the comment that ignores the package you no longer want to ignore.

Socket is designed to work without the need to analyze, upload, or share your source code. The only data we collect from your repository is the package.json file and associated lockfiles such as package-lock.json and yarn.lock , which we call the dependency snapshot . We use the dependency snapshot to determine the list of packages used by your repository, perform our open source risk analysis, and produce a report. To support mono-repos and projects which have multiple manifest files (e.g. package.json ) located in nested folders, e.g. foo/package.json or bar/package.json , Socket for GitHub requests read access to all code in the repository. We&#x27;re currently working with GitHub to improve their permissions model so we can reduce the required permissions to just read access to a glob pattern like **/package.json .

Quick overview of Socket for GitHub Socket watches for changes to “package manifest” files such as package.json, package-lock.json, and yarn.lock. Whenever a new dependency is added in a pull request, Socket analyzes the package&#x27;s behavior and leaves a comment if it is a security risk. By statically analyzing open source packages and their dependencies, Socket detects the tell-tale signs of a supply chain attack. Socket alerts developers when packages change in security-relevant ways, highlighting events such as the introduction of install scripts, obfuscated code, or usage of privileged APIs such as shell, network, filesystem, and environment variables. Socket automatically monitors GitHub pull requests for these software supply chain risks and many more: ✅ Detect potential typo squats ✅ Detect install scripts ✅ Detect telemetry ✅ Detect native code ✅ Detect known malware ✅ Detect shell script overrides ✅ Detect mutable git/http dependencies ✅ Detect invalid package manifests ✅ Detect protestware/troll packages Install scripts The npm package manager allows a package to specify an &quot;install script&quot; – an arbitrary shell command – that will run immediately when a package is installed. Install scripts are commonly used to build native code, print donation banners, or do other post-install tasks. However, this (anti-)feature is quite easy to abuse. The vast majority of malware on npm uses an install script to deliver its payload. In fact, a 2022 paper found nearly 94% of malicious packages had at least one install script. 📘 We found 93.9% [...] of malicious packages had at least one install script, indicating that malicious attackers use install scripts frequently Nusrat Zahan, et al Despite the pervasive use by malware, install scripts are in fact quite rare across the npm ecosystem. Most apps have only a handful of dependencies that use this powerful feature. Socket can now identify when a newly-added package contains an install script, or more worryingly, when a new version of an existing package introduces a new install script. When Socket identifies a new install script – a relatively rare and highly suspicious event – it will alert the developer via a GitHub comment so they can evaluate whether the install script is safe. In this real example from a user&#x27;s repo, Socket detected that the popular styled-components package decided to add a &quot;protestware&quot; install script in version 5.3.5: To help the developer investigate, Socket helpfully includes a link to the exact script that will run in the installation step. In this case, the install script is a benign instance of protestware, though some protestware is much more destructive . Telemetry Websites or apps often include a telemetry system that collects data about how users interact with a product. This data can help improve the product, catch bugs, or even detect abuse. While telemetry in apps is relatively common, telemetry in open source packages is quite unusual. We&#x27;ve heard from our users that they do not expect their dependencies to be collecting telemetry and sending it off to remote servers. Unfortunately, telemetry in open source dependencies is becoming more common. Socket can now detect packages that collect telemetry, alert the developer, and provide actionable information about how to disable the telemetry. In this real example, Socket detected that a newly introduced dependency, angular-calendar , is collecting telemetry: Socket helpfully identifies the package collecting the telemetry, @scarf/scarf , and provides information on how to opt-out of the telemetry system. Teams can now use Socket to keep dependencies that collect telemetry out of their codebases, or disable the telemetry functionality. Native code Packages which contain native code , i.e. compiled executable files, are rare on npm, but there are some. Native code is often used in packages that interface with a database, are performance-critical, or provide JavaScript bindings around native code. From a security perspective, native code is not ideal. Packages that include binaries are harder to audit since the source code may not be available, and you may need a binary disassembler to understand the package behavior. To complicate matters, packages may include different binaries for each supported platform and processor architecture. Worse still, a malicious actor may use native code to obscure their malware from JavaScript static analysis tools such as Socket or ESLint. At a more fundamental level, native code may prevent a package from running in certain environments such as browsers, Vercel Edge Functions, Cloudflare Workers, or Deno. Socket can now detect packages that contain native code and alert the developer, providing actionable information about how to disable the native code in cases where it&#x27;s optional. This detection also finds packages which do odd things, such as turning async functions into sync using a native code dependency like deasync . Known Malware When Socket confirms that a package contains malware, we report it to npm and add it to our list of known malware on npm . Our #1 priority is getting the malware removed from npm to protect the JavaScript ecosystem, whether those users use Socket or not. While npm is investigating the package, the malware remains available on npm. Socket can now protect users from known malware by detecting when a bad package version is installed and reporting it to the developer directly in a GitHub pull request. The Socket CLI (coming soon!) will also give developers a way to protect their own devices from known malware by intercepting bad npm install commands. Related: Socket tracks packages removed from npm for security reasons which is quite interesting to look through. It&#x27;s also a great way to see what package issues Socket would have detected in real historical instances of npm malware. Troll Packages npm contains many packages which are low-quality, jokes, parodies, or otherwise contain code not meant to be used in production. For example, there&#x27;s a package called bowserify that&#x27;s a Bowser-themed version of browserify . This parody package makes a few changes to the package such as including an image of Bowser (yes, the Nintendo character) and adding extra code into any JavaScript bundle that it produces – yikes! Some npm packages are named in a way designed to trick or confuse users, such as the package standardjs which is designed to confuse users of standard . Other packages, such as - (yes, the actual package name is a dash character), are frequently installed by accident when a user typos a command line flag to npm install . Socket can now protect users from misleading packages like these by reporting them directly to the developer inline in a GitHub pull request. Typosquats The most common attack vector is typosquatting. Typosquatting is when an attacker publishes a package which has a very similar name to a legitimate and popular package. Take these two packages with very similar names, for instance: npm install noblox.js-proxied npm install noblox.js-proxy One of these is legitimate and one of these is malware. But which is which? And what if you can&#x27;t remember and so you just take a guess? With the Socket GitHub App in place, the developer who opened the pull request (or the developer reviewing it) will have their attention drawn to this potential typosquat .

YAML # top level version field is required version: 2 projectIgnorePaths: - &quot;ignored-folder&quot; - &quot;foo/bar/package.json&quot; # only trigger pull request alerts when these files change. triggerPaths: - &quot;package.json&quot; - &quot;package-lock.json&quot; issueRules: unresolvedRequire: false githubApp: enabled: true # enable/disable the Socket.dev GitHub app entirely dependencyOverviewEnabled: true # enable/disable GitHub app dependency overview comments in pull request alerts. ignoreUsers: [&quot;aBotOnGitHub&quot;] disableCommentsAndCheckRuns: false 🚧 Note The socket.yml file is only supported in the root of your repo. The 4 letter extension variant is also supported ( socket.yaml ). If both extensions are present, socket.yml wins. Fields All fields listed here are optional, except for the version field. version The version field should not be omitted and should be set to 2. If it is missing or a lower number, see below for a migration guide. The version field sets the configuration schema used to validate socket.yml . projectIgnorePaths The projectIgnorePaths key is an array of strings that are used to ignore folders or files. The individual strings in the projectIgnorePaths array work like .gitignore patterns. The following patterns are always included in the ignore array by default: node_modules .yarn 🚧 Mind the YAML When using gitignore directives like ! and * , be sure that you wrap your selector rules in &quot; (double quotes). YAML supports some unquoted strings, however some characters break this feature so its safer to wrap your strings in &quot; . Advanced projectIgnorePaths example If you prefer to ignore ingesting all package manifest files by default, and instead only ingest specific files, you could utilize the following ignore string patterns to achieve that: yaml projectIgnorePaths: - &quot;/*&quot; - &quot;!/package.json&quot; - &quot;!/package-lock.json&quot; - &quot;!/workspaces&quot; - &quot;/workspaces/*&quot; - &quot;!/workspaces/foo&quot; - &quot;!/workspaces/bar&quot; In this example, we ignore everything in the root of the repo, unignore the workspaces directory and top level dependency manifests, ignore everything in the workspaces directory, then unignore the foo and bar subfolders. Any other folders in the workspaces directory will be ignored. triggerPaths The triggerPaths key is an array of strings that are used to match against files modified in pull requests and determine if a Pull Request alert scan should be performed. The individual strings in the triggerPaths array work like .gitignore patterns, except instead of matching files to ignore, match files that will trigger reports. When triggerPaths is omitted, the default rule set of [&quot;*&quot;] is used. The triggerPath rules are matched against all modified files inside of a pull request. If any of the rules match a file in a pull request, a Pull Request alert report is run and a check run indicator is displayed. This is a useful setting if you have a large monorepo and only want to roll socket out to a few sub-projects at a given time. It also separates out the report ingestion rules from the trigger rules so you can continue to ingest top level dependency manifest files that are common in monorepos but change frequently in shared contexts. triggerPaths determines when to run Pull Request alert reports, and projectIgnorePaths determines which paths are included when ingesting package manifest files for the report. Socket Security only ever ingests package manifest files and never any other source code. triggerPaths example If you only wanted to roll out the Socket Security GitHub app on the following directories in your repo: /workspaces/foo /workspaces/bar You could implement the following triggerPaths rule. YAML triggerPaths: - &quot;/workspaces/foo&quot; - &quot;/workspaces/bar&quot; If you combined this triggerPaths with the above projectIgnorePaths example above, Pull request alerts from Socket would only run when the pull request contained modified files inside of the foo and bar workspaces folder. issueRules 🚧 issueRules are deprecated While currently supported, we intend to replace socket.yml &#x27;s issueRules with repository labels . Repository labels provide the same functionality as issueRules , but with additional flexibility to apply the same rules to multiple repositories. issueRules is a map of issue names from Socket&#x27;s Issues page that allows you to enable or disable issue alerts in your pull requests. Issues are identified by the url slug of the corresponding issue page. The default issues map looks like this: YAML issueRules: didYouMean: true installScripts: true telemetry: true troll: true malware: true hasNativeCode: true shellScriptOverride: true gitDependency: true httpDependency: true invalidPackageJSON: true unresolvedRequire: true You can disable issue by setting it&#x27;s value to false. You can also enable alerts for any other issue that isn&#x27;t enabled by default by setting the issue slug value to true in the issues map. If any issue keys are omitted (having no entry at all in socket.yml ) they will use the values from the relevant Socket dashboard settings page. githubApp The githubApp is a map of settings that correspond to the Socket GitHub app . The contained settings are described below. githubApp.enabled Default: true . If you want the Socket GitHub app to never run on a repo and do not have org permissions to disable GitHub access to that repo, you can add a socket.yml file to your repo and set enabled to false. Setting enabled to false will override other settings in the socket.yml associated with the GitHub app. githubApp.pullRequestAlertsEnabled Default: true . The pullRequestAlertsEnabled field can be used to individually disable pull request alerts check runs and pull request comments generated by the Socket.dev GitHub app. The enabled field must be set to true for this field to have any effect. githubApp.dependencyOverviewEnabled Default: true . The dependencyOverviewEnabled field can be used to individually disable dependency overview comments in pull requests. The enabled and pullRequestAlertsEnabled field must be set to true for this field to have any effect. githubApp.projectReportsEnabled Default: true . The projectReportsEnabled field can be used to individually disable project reports check runs for commits from being generated. The enabled field must be set to true for this field to have any effect. githubApp.ignoreUsers Default: [] The ignoreUsers is an optional array of strings that let you specify GitHub usernames that will prevent Pull Request Alerts from running on Pull Requests that are opened by anyone specified in this array. This can be useful in merge queues or other bot related circumstances. githubApp.disableCommentsAndCheckRuns Default: false If you set &quot;Disable Comments and Check Runs&quot; to true in your organization settings, the GitHub app will continue to ingest and create reports on the repos that are installed in your Socket GitHub App installation, but will not post any comments or create check run status indicators in pull requests and commits. You can use this setting to override the organization setting for a specific repo. If &quot;Disable Comments and Check Runs&quot; is set to true in org settings, and githubApp.disableCommentsAndCheckRuns is set to false in socket.yml , the repo will continue getting comments and check run status indicators. If &quot;Disable Comments and Check Runs&quot; is set to false in org settings, and githubApp.disableCommentsAndCheckRuns is set to true in socket.yml , the repo will continue creating reports that populate in your Socket org dashboard, but will not receive any check run status indicators or comments in pull requests. Version 1 to Version 2 migration To migrate a Version 1 socket.yml to version 2, perform the following changes: Add the top level version key set to the value 2 Rename the ignore key to projectIgnorePaths Rename the issues key to issueRules Move the enabled , projectReportsEnabled and pullRequestAlertsEnabled keys under a top level githubApp key. Remove the beta key Existing v1 configuration files will continue to work, however newly added settings may not be accessible until you migrate your configuration to version 2.

This permission may seem broad, but its actual scope is strictly limited to the explicit permissions granted by the user. As clarified in the GitHub documentation : The GitHub App can only do things that both you and the app have permission to do. GitHub requires the &quot;Act on Your Behalf&quot; permission for third-party apps, like Socket, that use GitHub as an Identity Provider (IdP) to verify user identities. This permission is strictly limited to the actions explicitly allowed by the user. Socket requests this to identify active committers within your organization for accurate license compliance tracking but granting it is optional. Without it, open-source contributors may appear in reports. Alternatively, you can avoid using GitHub for authentication by setting up Single Sign-On (SSO) with an identity provider like Okta, as outlined in the Socket SSO Documentation .

Developers sometimes ask &quot;What do I do when I receive a Socket alert on added or updated dependencies?&quot;. Like all good questions, the first part of the answer tends to be &quot;It depends!&quot;. An example of a Socket alert Remove a package entirely If you happen to install a dependency that Socket reports as Known Malware or a Protestware/Troll Package , you should consider immediately removing it, or picking a different dependency. Take a closer look On the other hand, if you add or update a package that introduces an Install Script or Native Code you should take a quick moment to audit the source code of the package to make sure it&#x27;s not doing anything malicious. If Socket detects a Potential Typo Squat , you should ensure you actually installed the correct package before dismissing the alert. If you&#x27;re not sure what to do, you can always ask us , or someone on your security team, for help. Disable the offending package behavior Finally, if you add or update a package which collects Telemetry , then you can follow the instructions in the pull request alert to disable the offending package behavior, i.e. stop the collection of telemetry, in your app. Ignoring pull request alerts If a pull request triggers a dependency alert, repository contributors can use a bot command to mark the dependency as ignored for the GitHub App. Marking a dependency as ignored will rerun the pull request alert report and the dependency will be excluded from the new result. This can be useful if the repository utilizes protected branches that require all checks to pass, and you accept the implications of merging a given dependency change. Bot commands are issued by a repository contributor by writing a new comment in the pull request discussion, like this: @SocketSecurity ignore [email&#160;protected] Bot commands start with @SocketSecurity ignore followed by a space separated list of package-name@version specifiers. Bot commands must be the very first thing written in a comment, must be made by a contributor on the repo and can only be written in comments to the main pull request thread. Reports check the state of the pull request discussion whenever they are run, so re-running older check runs will take into account all the bot commands currently present in the pull request thread.

Settings The extension comes with various settings that can be configured by looking in your editor preferences under the &quot;Extensions&quot; tab &quot;Socket Security&quot; section. These settings can adjust which issues are shown and can disable reports if desiring to work in a zero network configuration. Team Management It may be desirable to suggest installing the VS Code extension for any team member. This can be done by adding a Workspace Recommended Extension in the .vscode/extensions.json file of the workspace root directory: JSON { &quot;recommendations&quot;: [ &quot;SocketSecurity.vscode-socket-security&quot; ] } Limitations Requires an internet connection for reports on package manifest files. This is to access the ocket API][] f for analysis. Some analysis such as bin confusion cannot be done using a reference to a single dependency. The extension only works on local files and does not integrate any organization level setting like the itHub App][] d does. This will likely change in the future. The extension only works on the current files on disk and not historical data. If you need historical diffing or other tracking features use the ithub App][]. . Auth and Permissions The extension will use an API token for creating tokens if setup to do so; however, it will function without providing an API token. The extension will try to use the same configuration as the CLI on disk. The API tokens used by the extension require the following scopes: report:read report:write Updated 4 days ago Socket MCP for Claude Desktop Socket JavaScript SDK Ask AI",

Tools exposed by the Socket MCP Server depscore The depscore tool allows AI assistants to query the Socket API for dependency scoring information. It provides comprehensive security and quality metrics for packages across different ecosystems. Parameters: Parameter Type Required Default Description packages Array ✅ Yes - Array of package objects to analyze packages[].ecosystem String No &quot;npm&quot; Package ecosystem ( npm , pypi , cargo , etc.) packages[].depname String ✅ Yes - Name of the dependency/package packages[].version String No &quot;unknown&quot; Version of the dependency Example Usage: JSON { &quot;packages&quot;: [ { &quot;ecosystem&quot;: &quot;npm&quot;, &quot;depname&quot;: &quot;express&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;4.18.2&quot; }, { &quot;ecosystem&quot;: &quot;pypi&quot;, &quot;depname&quot;: &quot;fastapi&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.100.0&quot; } ] } Sample Response: pkg:npm/ [email&#160;protected] : supply_chain: 1.0, quality: 0.9, maintenance: 1.0, vulnerability: 1.0, license: 1.0 pkg:pypi/ [email&#160;protected] : supply_chain: 1.0, quality: 0.95, maintenance: 0.98, vulnerability: 1.0, license: 1.0 How to Use the Socket MCP Server Ask your AI assistant to check dependencies: &quot;Check the security score for express version 4.18.2&quot; &quot;Analyze the security of my package.json dependencies&quot; &quot;What are the vulnerability scores for react, lodash, and axios?&quot; Get comprehensive security insights including supply chain, quality, maintenance, vulnerability, and license scores. Adjust tool usage with custom rules You can further customize how the Socket MCP server interacts with your AI assistant by modifying your client rules. The rules are usually a markdown file and its location depends on the AI assistant you are using. MCP Client Rules File Location Claude Desktop/Code CLAUDE.md VSCode Copilot .github/copilot-instructions.md Cursor .cursor/rules Rules that can be added to the client rules file include the following: Markdown Always check dependency scores with the depscore tool when you add a new dependency. If the score is low, consider using an alternative library or writing the code yourself. If you are unsure about the score, ask for a review from someone with more experience. When checking dependencies, make sure to also check the imports not just the pyproject.toml/package.json/dependency file. You can adjust the rules to fit your needs. For example, you can add rules to include specific manifest files, or guide the AI assistant on how to handle low scores. The rules are flexible and can be tailored to your workflow.

Getting an API key To use a local Socket MCP Server, you need to create an API key. You can do this by following these steps . The only required permission scope is packages:list , which allows the MCP server to query package metadata for dependency scores. For local deployment, you have two options: Stdio Mode (Default) Click a button below to install the self-hosted stdio server in your favorite AI assistant. Claude Code (stdio mode) can be set up with the following command: Bash claude mcp add socket-mcp -e SOCKET_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key-here&quot; -- npx -y @socketsecurity/mcp@latest This is how the configuration looks like on most MCP clients: JSON { &quot;mcpServers&quot;: { &quot;socket-mcp&quot;: { &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;, &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;@socketsecurity/mcp@latest&quot;], &quot;env&quot;: { &quot;SOCKET_API_KEY&quot;: &quot;your-api-key-here&quot; } } } } This approach automatically uses the latest version without requiring global installation. HTTP Mode Run the server in HTTP mode using npx: Bash MCP_HTTP_MODE=true SOCKET_API_KEY=your-api-key npx @socketsecurity/mcp@latest --http Configure your MCP client to connect to the HTTP server: JSON { &quot;mcpServers&quot;: { &quot;socket-mcp&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:3000&quot; } } } Updated 4 days ago Remote Socket MCP Socket MCP for Claude Desktop Ask AI",

You can create one following the instructions here . Start using Socket MCP: Example: &quot;Check the security of react&quot; Using Socket MCP Understanding Security Scores Socket provides scores from 0 to 100 for each security dimension. While there are no official thresholds, scores between 90 and 100 indicate a strong security profile. Scores from 70 to 80 suggest minor concerns but are generally acceptable. When scores fall between 50 and 60, you should review the package carefully before using it. Anything below 50 warrants looking for alternatives. Your acceptable thresholds may vary based on project requirements. Practical Examples Checking a new dependency: Evaluating packages with issues: Customizing Your Workflow Setting Claude Rules Add rules to Claude (Settings &gt; Profile &gt; personal preferences) for automatic security checks: # Security Checks When I mention adding a dependency or generating code that has new dependencies: 1.

It comes with types included, making your coding process smoother and more efficient. This SDK allows you to harness the full potential of Socket&#x27;s features in a more tailored way, giving you the flexibility to customize as per your specific needs. It&#x27;s like having a Swiss Army knife for your application security, ready to be wielded in the unique way that suits you best. Usage Bash npm install @socketsecurity/sdk ESM / TypeScript JavaScript import { SocketSdk } from &#x27;@socketsecurity/sdk&#x27; const client = new SocketSdk(&#x27;yourApiKeyHere&#x27;) const res = await client.getQuota() if (res.success) { // Will output { quota: 123 } if the quota you have left is 123 console.log(res.data) } CommonJS JavaScript const { SocketSdk } = require(&#x27;@socketsecurity/sdk&#x27;) SocketSdk Methods Package methods getIssuesByNPMPackage(packageName, version) packageName : A string representing the name of the npm package you want the issues for version : A string representing the version of the npm package to return the issues for getScoreByNPMPackage(packageName, version) packageName : A string representing the name of the npm package you want the score for version : A string representing the version of the npm package to return the score for Report methods createReportFromFilePaths(filePaths, pathsRelativeTo=., [issueRules]) filePaths : An array of absolute or relative string paths to package.json and any corresponding package-lock.json files pathsRelativeTo : A string path that the absolute paths filePaths are relative to. This to calculate where in your project the package.json / package-lock.json files lives issueRules : An object that follows the format of the socket.yml issue rules. Keys being issue names, values being a boolean that activates or deactivates it. Is applied on top of default config and organization config. getReportList() getReportSupportedFiles() getReport(id) id : A string representing the id of a created report Utility methods getQuota() getOrganizations() postSettings(selectors) selectors : An array of settings selectors, e.g. [{ organization: &#x27;id&#x27; }] Additional exports createUserAgentFromPkgJson(pkgJson) pkgJson : The content of the package.json you want to create a User-Agent string for Advanced Specifying custom user agent The SocketSdk constructor accepts an options object as its second argument and there a userAgent key with a string value can be specified. If specified then that user agent will be prepended to the SDK user agent. See this example: JavaScript const client = new SocketSdk(&#x27;yourApiKeyHere&#x27;, { userAgent: &#x27;example/1.2.3 (http://example.com/)&#x27; }) Which results in the HTTP User-Agent header : User-Agent: example/1.2.3 (http://example.com/) socketsecurity-sdk/0.5.2 (https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-sdk-js) To easily create a user agent for your code you can use the additional export createUserAgentFromPkgJson() like this, assuming pkgJson contains your parsed package.json : JavaScript const client = new SocketSdk(&#x27;yourApiKeyHere&#x27;, { userAgent: createUserAgentFromPkgJson(pkgJson) }) Specifying a custom user agent is good practice when shipping a piece of code that others can use to make requests. Eg. Socket CLI uses this option to identify requests coming from it + mentioning which version of it that is used.

Organization tokens can be created in your Socket organization settings and are scoped to the organization that you create them in. Authenticating requests to the Socket API can be done by passing the API token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header, or as the username field of an HTTP Basic authentication header. To authenticate using a Bearer token, pass the API token in the Authorization header after the work &quot;Bearer&quot;: curl --request GET \\ --url &#x27;https://api.socket.dev/v0/orgs/org_slug/full-scans&#x27; \\ --header &#x27;accept: application/json&#x27; \\ --header &#x27;authorization: Bearer your_api_key&#x27; To authenticate a request, provide your API token through HTTP Basic authentication in the request. The API token is used as the username and the password is left blank (ie. your_api_key: encoded in Base64). An example is shown below: cURL curl https://api.socket.dev/v0/quota -X GET -u &quot;your_api_key:&quot;",

To authenticate API requests, you need to use API tokens. This guide will show you how to generate and manage these tokens within your organization. Generating a New API Token To generate a new API token: Navigate to Settings : On the Socket dashboard, go to Settings in the left-hand menu. Access API Tokens : Click on the API Tokens tab within the Settings menu. Create API Token : Click the + Create API token button in the upper-right corner. A dialog will appear where you can set the name and choose the scopes for the token. After selecting the appropriate scopes, click Confirm to generate the token. Editing and Managing API Tokens To edit an API token, navigate to the API Tokens section. Click on the ellipsis ( ... ) next to the token you want to manage. You can Edit name , Edit scopes , Edit visibility , Rotate token , or Revoke token as needed. Best Practices Least Privilege Principle : Assign only the necessary scopes to each token to minimize potential security risks. Regular Rotation : Regularly rotate your tokens to reduce the impact of a compromised token. Audit and Review : Periodically review the tokens and their scopes to ensure they align with current organizational needs and security practices.",

Historical snapshots are automatically collected at least once a day but customers can request on-demand snapshots (within the limits of their pricing plan). Historical data is automatically &quot;bucketed&quot; to the nearest day by truncating the scan date to the nearest day based on the UTC time zone. For example, if a scan occurs at January 1, 2025 3:15pm UTC then the data collected for that scan will be associated with the day starting at January 1, 2025 12am UTC. This approach to bucketing data impacts how data is aggregated by day when fetching trend data. Also, when fetching historical data, the returned data is filtered to include only the data based on the last scan of each day for a given source code repository. For example, if a specific repository is scanned 5 times on January 1, 2025, the only the data for the last scan on January 1, 2025 will be returned. The Socket API provides the following endpoints for accessing and managing historical data: List historical alerts Fetch trend data for historical alerts List details of periodic historical data snapshots Start historical data snapshot job The Socket platform strives to provide consistent ingestion of historical data but there may be delays or gaps when collecting historical data. Customers should use the API endpoint for listing recent historical snapshots to review the history of snapshots.",

Compatible witch CycloneDX reports. Package URLs (PURLs) are an ecosystem agnostic way to identify packages. CycloneDX SBOMs use the purl format to identify components. This endpoint supports fetching metadata and alerts for multiple packages at once by passing an array of purl strings, or by passing an entire CycloneDX report. More information on purl and CycloneDX: purl Spec CycloneDX Spec This endpoint returns the latest available alert data for artifacts in the batch (stale while revalidate). Actively running analysis will be returned when available on subsequent runs. Examples: Looking up an npm package: { &quot;components&quot;: [ { &quot;purl&quot;: &quot;pkg:npm/ [email&#160;protected] &quot; } ] } Looking up an PyPi package: { &quot;components&quot;: [ { &quot;purl&quot;: &quot;pkg:pypi/ [email&#160;protected] &quot; } ] } Looking up a Maven package: { &quot;components&quot;: [ { &quot;purl&quot;: &quot;pkg:maven/log4j/ [email&#160;protected] &quot; } ] } Batch lookup { &quot;components&quot;: [ { &quot;purl&quot;: &quot;pkg:npm/ [email&#160;protected] &quot; }, { &quot;purl&quot;: &quot;pkg:pypi/ [email&#160;protected] &quot; }, { &quot;purl&quot;: &quot;pkg:maven/log4j/ [email&#160;protected] &quot; } ] } This endpoint consumes 100 units of your quota. This endpoint requires the following org token scopes: packages:list License Attribution License attribution information for a resource at a given PURL can be requested by setting the query parameter licenseattrib=true . License attribution information is returned as a JSON object in the following format: attribText: string attribData: Array&lt;{ purl: string, foundInFilepath?: string spdxExpr: string, foundAuthors: Array&lt;string&gt; }&gt; The attribText attribute contains the contents of the license that was found, or the model text of the license if the license information was found via package metadata. For example, if an npm package contains a LICENSE file with slight modifications inserting the actual author names and copyright dates, the precise contents of that LICENSE file will occupy the attribText field, but if the license information concerns the presence of an SPDX identifier MIT in the package.json file, attribText will contain the base text of the MIT license. The attribData attribute is an array with one element for each occurrence of the license text in question. Because an identical license text may be used an arbitrary number of times in a large code base, this helps keep the size of responses manageable. The purl attribute corresponds to the purl of the resource in which this license information was found, while foundInFilepath contains the relative path to the location of the license information within the resource (package or artifact). foundInFilepath may be null if the license information was gleaned from resource metadata. spdxExpr contains an SPDX expression describing the license content. foundAuthors is an array of additional author information found which is relevant to that particular appearance/instance of the license. For example, if a python package has a pyproject.toml file which identifies the MIT license and contains an array of author names and email addresses, the array entry for that particular attribData will have a purl pointing to that package/artifact, a relative path to the pyproject.toml file, an SPDX expression identifying the MIT license, and an array containing the author information present in the pyproject.toml file. License Details More fine-grained details concerning license identification can be requested by setting the query parameter licensedetails=true . License details are returned as a JSON object in the following format: spdxDisj: string provenance: string filepath?: string match_strength: float The spdxDisj attribute contains an SPDX expression identifying the license match The provenance attribute contains information concerning the provenance of the license data (in a more detailed sense than just resource path, where did we find this license info?) The filepath attribute contains a relative path to the resource used to identify this license information if it exists (for license information taken from something like package metadata, there may not be an appropriate filepath) The match_strength property contains a value between 0 and 1 describing the strength of the license match (0 for no similarity, 1 for identical contents). For license data found by examining SPDX expressions, this property will be 1 .

This is used to prevent an abuse of expensive API calls. If the maximum quota of an API token has been exceeded, the API will return a 429 error and the Retry-After header will contain the number of seconds until you can call that same endpoint successfully (ie. have enough quota for that endpoint).",

A Socket purl is based on the standard as documented here . There is a good description from that page: A packageUrl (commonly pronounced and referred to as &quot;purl&quot;) is an attempt to standardize package representations in order to reliably identify and locate software packages. A purl is a URL string which represents a package in a mostly universal and uniform way across programming languages, package managers, packaging conventions, tools, APIs and databases. A Socket purl as used with the packages API and the specific definition for the format can be found at the Github Spec . Constructing a Socket purl The format for a purl is like the following: scheme:type/namespace/name@version In the case of the Socket Packages endpoint the scheme is always going to be pkg . Here are some examples for different eccosystems: npm pkg:npm/ [email&#160;protected] Python pkg:pypi/ [email&#160;protected] Maven pkg:maven/log4j/ [email&#160;protected]",

This feature works similarly to the. gitignore file patterns. By adding paths to projectIgnorePaths , you can control where Socket runs and where it doesn&#x27;t. To incrementally rollout Socket using projectIgnorePaths , you can start by adding all project subfolders to projectIgnorePaths. This prevents Socket from running on any of them. YAML projectIgnorePaths: - &quot;subfolder1&quot; - &quot;subfolder2&quot; - &quot;subfolder3&quot; Once you&#x27;ve set this up, you can gradually remove subfolders from projectIgnorePaths as you see fit, effectively enabling Socket incrementally",

YAML supports some unquoted strings, however some characters break this feature so its safer to wrap your strings in &quot;. Using triggerPaths for Incremental Rollout The triggerPaths key in socket. yml works similarly to projectIgnorePaths. It uses the same. gitignore style syntax, except instead of matching files to ignore, it matches files to trigger Pull Request alerts on against the set of files modified in a pull request",

Any other Pull Requests would not see a Socket check run generated in their check suite. triggerPaths can be used along side projectIgnorePaths. triggerPaths determines when reports are run and projectIgnorePaths determines which package manifest files are included in the report. Leveraging Silent Mode for Incremental Rollout Silent mode allows you to deploy Socket in a non-intrusive way. In silent mode, Socket does not produce any visible indicators like PR alerts, GitHub checks, Dependency Overview Comments, or Security Alerts on your GitHub repository. Instead, all alerts are sent exclusively to a designated Slack channel. To leverage silent mode for an incremental rollout, you would first enable silent mode for your entire repository",

This will enable Socket to start producing visible alerts and comments on your GitHub repository. Remember, to enable silent mode, you need to contact Socket support, as it cannot be enabled directly through the socket. yml file. Conclusion An incremental rollout of Socket provides a measured and controlled integration of the tool into your project. Whether you prefer to use projectIgnorePaths to selectively choose where Socket runs, or silent mode to observe Socket&#x27;s operation in a non-intrusive manner, you have the flexibility to implement Socket in a way that best suits your team&#x27;s needs and comfort levels",

It assists with: SOC 2 Compliance : By ensuring that all dependencies are secure, Socket supports the security and availability principles required for SOC 2. ISO 27001 : Helps maintain the integrity and confidentiality of information by managing software vulnerabilities. HIPAA : Ensures that software dependencies do not introduce risks to sensitive health information. Why Is an Integration Between the Tools Beneficial. Integrating Socket with Vanta enhances your organization&#x27;s security and compliance efforts by: Automatically synchronizing security alerts from Socket to Vanta, ensuring all potential issues are tracked in one place. Simplifying the audit process by maintaining a consistent and comprehensive view of your security posture",

How to Enable It Integrate from the Settings Page Navigate to the Settings Page : Go to the Socket Dashboard. Set Up the Integration : Find the Vanta integration option under the &quot;Integrations&quot; section. Follow the prompts to authorize the connection between Socket and Vanta. Synchronization : Once the link is set up, all Organization Alerts will be synchronized to your Vanta instance. Alerts will respect your Security Policy , ensuring only relevant issues are reported. How the Integration Works Authorization via OAuth To enable the integration, you will connect your Vanta instance to Socket using OAuth. Upon completion, Socket will store a refresh token in your organization settings for ongoing communication with Vanta. ⚠️ Important Caveat: Vanta often revokes these tokens",

If this happens, the integration may appear broken. The recommended fix is to re-authorize the integration via the Socket dashboard. What Gets Synced Alerts: Whenever Socket scans the default branch (triggered via GitHub webhook events, not the GitHub API), it stores all alerts internally and sends the current snapshot to Vanta every 45 minutes.

We are all driven to defend the open source ecosystem from supply chain attacks and make it safe for everyone. What does Socket do. Socket is unique because, unlike other tools, it detects and blocks supply chain attacks before they strike, mitigating the worst consequences: Supply Chain Attack Prevention: Prevent compromised or hijacked packages from infiltrating your supply chain by monitoring all dependency changes in real-time. Package Behavior Analysis: Detect when dependency updates introduce new risky API usage such as network, shell, filesystem, etc. Comprehensive Protection: Block malware, typo-squatting, hidden code, misleading packages, permission creep, and 60+ red flags in open source code.

      "content": "The market is flooded with vulnerability scanners (which find CVEs in your dependencies) and static analysis tools (which analyze your app code). Both of these approaches are less than helpful at detecting supply chain attacks of the sort we&#x27;ve seen exploding in the open source ecosystem. Vulnerability scanning tools merely look up the packages you&#x27;re using and compare them to data in the public CVE databases such as NVD. When they find a match, they send you an alert to upgrade to a new version. This is too slow to stop an active supply chain attack. Traditional static analysis tools are way too noisy when run on third-party code, and don&#x27;t provide actionable results. Most developers aren&#x27;t running static analysis tools on their own code, let alone third-party code. Socket is different.

Unlike a traditional vulnerability scanner, Socket can actually detect an active supply chain attack. Unlike a traditional static analysis tool, Socket provides actionable feedback about dependency risk, instead of hundreds of meaningless alerts. How does Socket&#x27;s code analysis work. Socket analyzes the open source dependencies used in your software. Unlike traditional security tools that focus on finding vulnerabilities in your own code, Socket looks at the code of your third-party dependencies.

This includes looking for new install scripts, network requests, environment variable access, telemetry, suspicious strings, obfuscated code, and dozens of other signals, all of which can be signs of malicious activity. We use a custom static analysis engine developed in-house to analyze every package across the entire npm ecosystem (and very soon, PyPI, Go, Maven, etc. ). In addition to static analysis, Socket also analyzes maintainer behavior. This means we look at who is maintaining the package and their activity history. This is important because a package with a history of questionable maintenance or a new maintainer with no track record can be a red flag for potential attacks. We also warn about unmaintained packages, trivial packages, and packages which have recently undergone major refactors",

For example, a package may load code from a remote git repository or a remote HTTP server, totally bypassing your package lockfile. This allows attackers to load whatever code they want, and even serve different packages to different IP addresses, making it really hard to have a reproducible build or figure out what code is actually going to be run when you install a package. Another use of package metadata is to detect typosquats. We use Levenshtein distance and package download counts to detect packages which impersonate other legitimate packages. For example webb3 is a malicious typo of web3 because the name is similar and the legitimate package has 300,000 times as many downloads as the malicious one. In total, we look for 70+ signals in open source packages, which use different combinations of these 3 techniques – static analysis, package metadata analysis, and maintainer behavior analysis",

Socket uses static analysis (and soon, dynamic analysis) to characterize the behavior of a package and determine what capabilities it uses, which we call “capability detection”. For instance, to determine if an npm package uses the network , Socket looks at whether fetch() , or Node&#x27;s net , dgram , dns , or http or https modules are used within the package or – and this part is key – any of its dependencies. Socket also uses static analysis to detect usage of privileged APIs such as shell, filesystem, eval(), and environment variables. In total, Socket detects 70+ security red flags in open source code, divided over spectrum of issues. What about side channels, such as maintainer behavior. Some of the most valuable security signals come from side channels such as maintainer behavior",

We also detect when packages are published out of chronological order because attackers often publish new patches on old major versions which still have a lot of usage. Another example of an attack which goes beyond the code in a package is typosquatting , which is one of the most common supply chain attack vectors. We define a typosquat as: Package name is 1-2 characters away from a more popular package The legit package has 1,000x more monthly downloads than the typo package For example, look at how we handle the bowserify package which is a typo.

On the Security Policy page, you can see various alert types categorized by severity: Block, Warn, Monitor, and Ignore. Example Security Policy Configuration It&#x27;s important to configure your security policy to meet your organization&#x27;s specific requirements. Here&#x27;s an example configuration: Block : Known Malware, Critical CVE Warn : Install Scripts, AI Detected Security Risk Monitor : Network Access, Medium CVE Ignore : Low CVE, Non-existent Author Alert Actions Alert Action Shows up in Dashboard Developers see it (e. g",

All related alerts will appear in the dashboard, developers will be notified, and further actions will be blocked. ❗ Warn : This action indicates a potential issue that should be reviewed. It will appear in the dashboard and notify developers through comments or warnings, but it will not block the development process. 👁️ Monitor : This action is used for tracking alerts that require monitoring over time. Alerts will be visible in the dashboard, but no notifications will be sent to developers, and it won&#x27;t block any processes. ➖ Ignore : This action is set for low-priority alerts or informational notifications.

However, users can override this action for specific alerts to allow for flexible and context-specific responses. This helps reduce alert fatigue while prioritizing the mitigation of critical and high supply chain risks in your codebase. Common Use Cases Dismissing Alerts : Reasons for dismissal include: A fix has already been started. No bandwidth to fix this. Risk is tolerable to the project. Vulnerable code is not actually used. Example: Dismissing an alert after confirming that the vulnerable code path is not exercised in your application. Upgrading Alert Severity : Example: An Install Script alert initially set to Monitor can be elevated to Block after evaluation. Steps to Triage an Alert Identify the Alert : Locate the alert in the Socket dashboard. Select an Action : Choose to Block, Warn, Monitor, or Ignore based on the specific context",

For more details on scanning methods, visit the rest of our docs pages (see sidebar). Note Socket scans artifacts published to PyPI, with Anaconda Cloud support planned on Socket’s roadmap. Socket supports the PyPI registry and therefore we can report risks for any Anaconda package which is also published to PyPI. Since Anaconda packages are built from the same source as PyPI packages, most supply chain risks, vulnerabilities, quality, license, and maintenance issues can still be detected—but some supply chain threats may only be identified once Anaconda artifact scanning is supported",

      "content": "This exponent compresses low scores and softens the impact of penalties, especially for large or popular packages. Each metric may also optionally apply a limit. Critical Alerts: When any critical alerts are present, this metric is limited to the minimum of 0. 25 and a weighted average of other scoring signals. The limit of 0. 25 acts as a soft cap because the final score is calculated as 100 × (min(limit, weighted-average))^γ. For example, when γ = 0. 8, a cap of 0. 25 leads to a final score of about 33%. However, if the weighted average is lower than 0. 25, the final score can fall even further. High Alerts: High alerts reduce the score using an exponential decay, e^−x. The metric is capped at max(0. 25, 1 − x/10), bottoming out at 0. 25 when there are 8 or more alerts. The actual contribution can go lower due to weighted averaging.

Even though the limit flattens, the normalized value can fall below 0. 5 and continue decreasing. Low Alerts: Low alerts have the least impact. They decay gently with e^−x/40 and have no cap, so their effect on the score remains small and gradual. Other Factors: Package scores are also influenced by project attributes like popularity, size, and maintenance activity. These affect the γ exponent. Larger or more widely used packages tend to have a smaller γ, which reduces the impact of negative metrics and allows those packages to maintain relatively higher scores even when some alerts are present.

How Dependency Reachability Works 1. From Manifest to Map The analysis scans your manifest files ( package. json , go. mod , Gemfile , pom. xml , build. gradle , and others) to generate a complete list of direct and transitive dependencies, along with the dependency graph that connects them. 2. Dependency-Only Scanning — No Access to Your Source Code For each supported language, Socket parses only the files from dependency packages— never your proprietary source code—and extracts every import statement (e. g. , import , require , or using ). Language Parser Example we catch JavaScript / TypeScript tree‑sitter‑javascript import { useState } from &#x27;react&#x27; Python tree‑sitter‑python from pathlib import Path Go tree‑sitter‑go import &quot;github",

DataSource; Privacy first: Your source code is never uploaded or stored. The scan runs in a secure worker, extracts only the package names, and immediately discards the file contents. 3. Dead vs. Alive If a transitive package never appears in any import statement, Socket marks it as dead. Then, it walks the dependency graph in the following way: If a parent is marked as dead, its children are also marked as dead— unless they are also required by a live parent. Direct dependencies are always considered alive, since the analysis doesn’t scan application source code to determine how it interacts with its direct dependencies.

Enabling the Feature Dependency Reachability is already enabled by default for users on the free tier—no action needed. For paid plans, it’s currently opt-in via the Settings page. We’ve kept it optional during the beta since the additional source-code scan can add a small delay to SBOM generation. After the beta, Reachability will be enabled by default for all plans, with a toggle available if you prefer to turn it off. No additional configuration or build steps required. When you enable Reachability, you&#x27;ll see a significant reduction in noise—on average, 25–35% of transitive dependencies are filtered out as unused.

The benefits of precomputed reachability include: Good noise reduction – It offers better noise reduction than dependency reachability by analyzing usage at the function level. High performance – Results for most dependency chains are precomputed and cached by Socket, making the analysis extremely fast.

The vulnerability CVE-2024-37890 affects the npm package ws , which is used to create WebSocket clients and servers. It’s a serious issue—an attacker can crash a ws server just by sending a request with many headers. If you’re using the WebSocketServer from ws directly, you should patch this vulnerability as soon as possible. But many developers don’t depend on ws directly. Instead, they inherit it as an indirect/transitive dependency through other packages in the npm ecosystem. Even if you never import ws yourself, you’ll still get an alert about this CVE if some package in your dependency tree pulls it in. These indirect usages might still be vulnerable—but in many cases, reachability analysis can prove they’re not. Consider the package jsdom , which depends on ws (See jsdom&#x27;s package. json )",

A static reachability analysis can check that jsdom doesn’t use the vulnerable part of ws , and this information can be stored in a database. So, when an SCA tool detects CVE-2024-37890 in your SBOM or dependency tree, it can safely mark it as unreachable—if jsdom is the only package that depends on ws. If more packages depends on ws , then reachability information must be computed for these packages as well. How Precomputed Reachability Works 1.

For each of these paths, a static analysis is performed to check the reachability of the affected function (You can learn more about Socket&#x27;s static reachability analysis here ). If reachability has already been computed for a specific path, the result is reused. 4. Reachable vs Unreachable CVEs If the affected function(s) are unreachable through all paths in the dependency graph, the CVE is marked as unreachable.

This means that if your code loads a phantom dependency —a package not listed in your manifest file—vulnerabilities in that package may be incorrectly classified as unreachable.

It&#x27;s possible for npm uninstall or npm rm to actually install new packages. So, as counterintuitive as it might seem, you also need to be careful when running npm uninstall. Fortunately, Socket protects you in that situation if you use socket npm uninstall – so not to worry. Wait, why would npm uninstall ever install new packages. npm creates what is called the &quot;ideal tree&quot; for a given package. json. So by removing a package you might actually change what the ideal tree is. Removing a package may remove a constraint which is keeping a package on an older version, so then npm may update those packages to a more ideal/recent version. For example, if foo depends on [ [email&#160;protected] ](mailto: [email&#160;protected] ) it will constrain bar to be on 1. 1",

There were lots of interesting things we had to do in order to completely cover various situations in npm and avoid some escapes that would bypass our wrapper. When you alias the wrapper with alias npm=&quot;socket npm&quot; it would have been buggy if we didn&#x27;t guard against basic child process invocation. For example running npm run will invoke a child process that can remove that alias. To that end, we are doing some tricks to protect against this. More information can be found in our documentation",

Install scripts are commonly used to build native code, print donation banners, or do other post-install tasks. However, this (anti-)feature is quite easy to abuse.

Most apps have only a handful of dependencies that use this powerful feature. Socket can now identify when a newly-added package contains an install script, or more worryingly, when a new version of an existing package introduces a new install script. When Socket identifies a new install script – a relatively rare and highly suspicious event – it will alert the developer via a GitHub comment so they can evaluate whether the install script is safe.

While telemetry in apps is relatively common, telemetry in open source packages is quite unusual.

Native code Packages which contain native code , i. e. compiled executable files, are rare on npm, but there are some. Native code is often used in packages that interface with a database, are performance-critical, or provide JavaScript bindings around native code. From a security perspective, native code is not ideal.

For example, if a scan occurs at January 1, 2025 3:15pm UTC then the data collected for that scan will be associated with the day starting at January 1, 2025 12am UTC. This approach to bucketing data impacts how data is aggregated by day when fetching trend data. Also, when fetching historical data, the returned data is filtered to include only the data based on the last scan of each day for a given source code repository. For example, if a specific repository is scanned 5 times on January 1, 2025, the only the data for the last scan on January 1, 2025 will be returned",

A purl is a URL string which represents a package in a mostly universal and uniform way across programming languages, package managers, packaging conventions, tools, APIs and databases. A Socket purl as used with the packages API and the specific definition for the format can be found at the Github Spec. Constructing a Socket purl The format for a purl is like the following: scheme:type/namespace/name@version In the case of the Socket Packages endpoint the scheme is always going to be pkg. Here are some examples for different eccosystems: npm pkg:npm/ [email&#160;protected] Python pkg:pypi/ [email&#160;protected] Maven pkg:maven/log4j/ [email&#160;protected]",
